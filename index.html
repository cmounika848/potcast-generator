You’ve carefully chosen each item, but then you’re notified that some products might not be in stock at the store. That’s where Instacart’s machine learning model steps in, facing the challenge of accurately predicting suitable replacements that match your preferences. This blog post will explore the complex challenges Instacart overcomes in building a robust replacement recommendation model and the innovative solutions implemented to ensure smooth and satisfactory replacements.</p><p>The replacement recommendation model sits at the heart of the replacement experience for our customers and shoppers. In a previous post, <a href="https://www.instacart.com/company/how-its-made/the-story-behind-an-instacart-order-part-3-predicting-the-shop/">The Story Behind an Instacart Order</a>, we provided a sneak peek into this model and how our customers engage with it when placing orders. In this blog post, we intend to delve deeper into the machine-learning aspects of the replacement model, shedding light on the various decisions we made throughout its development.</p><h3>Why Do Replacement Decisions Matter?</h3><p>One of Instacart’s key challenges is <a href="https://tech.instacart.com/how-instacart-modernized-the-prediction-of-real-time-availability-for-hundreds-of-millions-of-items-59b2a82c89fe">predicting product availability</a> without real-time inventory data. Our machine-learning model prompts replacement suggestions if a product appears unavailable when an Instacart customer shops. This replacement model also assists Instacart shoppers in selecting the best replacements during their shopping trips. Refer to Figure 1 for an example of how replacement recommendations are displayed within our product interface.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2odDYpty0QkiuYw6HcVUpg.png" /><figcaption>Figure 1. Instacart shows replacement recommendations to customers under the banner <strong>“replace with the specific item”</strong> and to shoppers under <strong>“most similar options”</strong></figcaption></figure><h3>Technical Challenges We Faced</h3><p><strong>Head vs Tail Problem: </strong>Popular products, often receiving substantial customer engagement, are easier to rank due to abundant data. However, we primarily depend on catalog attributes to recommend effective replacements for less frequently purchased (tail) items or newly introduced products (cold start). This approach might only sometimes result in high customer approval. Ensuring a balance between these extremes is crucial for customer satisfaction.</p><p><strong>Optimizing for Retailer-Specific Inventory: </strong>Using a uniform model across various retailers can introduce biases and reduce relevance. Tailoring replacements to consider each retailer’s unique stock and customer preferences enhances the accuracy and satisfaction of recommendations.</p><p><strong>Availability and Ranking Dilemma: </strong>A significant challenge arises when top-ranked replacements are also out of stock, necessitating the need for lower-ranked items to serve as effective alternatives. These options must still be well-aligned with customer expectations.</p><p><strong>Diverse User Preferences: </strong>Customer preferences are highly nuanced and specific, often involving unique needs across various product attributes such as size, flavor, and brand. Meeting these complex expectations is challenging but essential to avoid dissatisfaction. Understanding and accurately matching these multilayered preferences are crucial to delivering effective product replacements.</p><h3>Replacement Model Overview</h3><p>The primary aim of the replacement model is to suggest suitable substitutes for out-of-stock products that closely match the original product and align with customer preferences, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction. In this blog, we will focus on the user-agnostic subsystem of our replacement model, which is one part of the more extensive replacement system. This critical subsystem allows us to cater to a broad demographic by leveraging general replacement patterns for Instacart customers. Figure 2 provides an overview of the machine learning models that generate user-agnostic product recommendations. While this post highlights these foundational methodologies for delivering broad recommendations, the system’s true strength lies in its ability to adapt and refine through advanced mechanisms like personalization, cart context, etc. — topics we will explore in future blog posts.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6osrV0j_R_5YjoTxushe2Q.png" /><figcaption>Figure 2. Replacement Model Overview</figcaption></figure><h3>Part 1: Cold Start Model</h3><p>Inspired by other recommendation systems in the industry [<a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45530.pdf">1</a>], we adopt a <em>funnel</em> approach. The initial retrieval stage is a heuristics-based system that filters the candidates to a manageable amount. The candidates then undergo a subsequent ranking process using our ML ranking model.</p><h4>Retrieval (Candidate Generation)</h4><p><strong>Methodology — </strong>For a given product, we need to be able to identify other products as candidates for replacement and score these candidates based on various criteria, such as historical customer approval or similarity based on dietary attributes. Given our extensive product catalog, scoring the similarity of every possible pair of products would be computationally prohibitive, so we apply heuristics to generate a candidate list for each source product. We utilize a blend of strategies to select candidates:</p><ul><li>Engagement — Product pairs from past replacements (say, frozen blueberry for fresh blueberry)</li><li>Taxonomy — Products that fall into the same category in our catalog (say, organic blueberry for regular blueberry)</li><li>Aisle — Products within the same aisle based on placement inside the store (say, 11 oz pack of blueberry for an 18 oz pack)</li><li>Semantic Proximity — Products that are semantically similar based on catalog attributes (say, dried blueberry for fresh blueberry).</li></ul><p>To limit the number of candidates per product to a couple hundred, we employ a combination of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein distance</a> between product names and product popularity. According to recent data, more than 95% of replacements picked by Instacart shoppers are included within the candidate set generated by this methodology.</p><p><strong>Example — </strong>Figure 3 presents the engagement and taxonomy candidates generated by our pipeline, using a <em>honey-flavored cerea</em>l as an example.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rpqQ8fn8fdBEqDiga53vgw.png" /><figcaption>Figure 3. Example with taxonomy and engagement candidates</figcaption></figure><h4>Ranking</h4><p>We’ve devised a supervised deep-learning model that optimizes for customer approvals — that is, to maximize the likelihood that customers will accept a candidate product as a suitable replacement should the source product be out of stock. The model considers the different product attributes from our catalog and is trained on customer impressions on Instacart. We favored a pointwise approach for its simplicity in integrating the pointwise ranking score with other relevant business logic. Employing our trained model, we refresh the scoring pipeline weekly to fetch and score new replacement candidates using automated data pipelines. This practice ensures maximum coverage and mitigates the cold start problem for any newly introduced products and retailers at Instacart.</p><p><strong>Labels — </strong>The raw training pairs are generated using customer replacement impressions on the Instacart app and website. Positive instances derive from impressions where customers selected their replacement preferences. We synthesize negative instances from a blend of randomly chosen negatives and implicit feedback based on the options displayed to customers that they opted not to select. Such sampling techniques are widely used in other industry-grade recommender systems [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2988450.2988454">2</a>][<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LinKamarHorvitzCorrected.pdf">3</a>][<a href="https://research.facebook.com/publications/practical-lessons-from-predicting-clicks-on-ads-at-facebook/">4</a>].</p><p><strong>Features — </strong>Primarily, we use four types of features:</p><ul><li>Text features: product_name.</li><li>Categorical: brand, size, aisle, department, product category, cost_unit, etc.</li><li>Binary: dietary attributes like kosher, organic, vegan, vegetarian, fat-free, etc.</li><li>Pre-trained embeddings: <a href="https://www.instacart.com/company/how-its-made/how-instacart-uses-embeddings-to-improve-search-relevance/">product embeddings</a> provided by our Search Team.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GZSBTDjEcq2aQ1-zeWfnBw.png" /><figcaption>Figure 4. Siamese Network</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*y83qbp7UZDeaBfuJ1Vm_xw.png" /><figcaption>Figure 5. Product Layer (one each for original and candidate product)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Model architecture — </strong>Our model uses a Siamese network that leverages identical weights to simultaneously process two different input vectors, creating output that can be easily compared. This configuration mirrors the classic ‘two-tower’ architecture prevalent in recommendation and search ranking applications. The architecture of our model is illustrated in Figure 4. The product layer consolidates the four types of features mentioned above into an embedding representation for a product, represented by Figure 5. The model employs a BERT-based sentence embedding layer to process product name text features, and embedded representations for high-cardinality categorical features are learned from scratch during model training.</p><p><strong>Model Evaluation — </strong>For offline evaluation, we utilize the following metrics:</p><ul><li>Validation loss (log-loss) during model training using a validation set.</li><li>Area-under-curve (AUC) using a randomly split test data set.</li><li>Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Recall@k utilizing a holdout dataset following the production replacements flow.</li><li>Manual review for quality evaluation of top replaced products.</li></ul><p>For online evaluation and launch decisions, we run online A/B tests and closely monitor key metrics such as replacement satisfaction and customer approval rates for statistical significance.</p><p><strong>Example — </strong>A higher model score suggests that if a customer’s preferred product isn’t available, they will likely select that specific candidate as a substitute. Figure 6 shows an example candidate pair with that the Deep Learning model has given a score = 0.653, indicating a 65.3% probability that customers will approve this replacement. Looking at feature importances, we identified the following features as having the highest importance: <em>size difference, brand similarity, matches in product names, and difference in pre-trained product embeddings.</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uL3WEJyQUghkQRLdkiZJ7A.png" /><figcaption>Figure 6. An example candidate pair</figcaption></figure><h3>Part 2: Engagement Model — solving head vs tail problem</h3><p>The above model performs well in most scenarios, but it is specifically sub-optimal for frequently replaced head products. After examining hundreds of examples, we identified the need for a “memorization” component to store top replacements for these head products. While the deep learning (DL) model is effective at generalization, recommendation systems often benefit from a memory component, as discussed in relevant literature [<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/258052834c68ec2a850db090546d6809f0ce5c10.pdf">5</a>][<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3041021.3054202">6</a>]. This led us to develop an engagement model that excels at memorization for head products, while the DL model’s generalization capabilities benefit torso/tail products. The engagement model leverages customer engagement data to compute historical approval rates, adjusting for confidence intervals and precompute scores for head product pairs exceeding a certain impression threshold.</p><p>Using the <em>honey-flavored cereal</em> example, Figure 7 displays the top four recommendations generated by our DL model. We’ve found that all of the top four candidate replacements are equally viable. Still, upon examining historical data on this product’s previous replacements, we found that most recommended products receive relatively low customer approval rates. There are other alternatives that Instacart customers pick more often.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kYXmemR6mQ91iE7lnNJVrA.png" /><figcaption>Figure 7. Replacement recommendations from the deep learning model</figcaption></figure><p>As depicted in Figure 8, the top recommendations for the same original product from the engagement model (employing engagement data) substantially differ from those suggested by the deep learning model (using catalog data and product embeddings). We observe that a few cereals are top choices among Instacart customers as substitutes for the <em>Honey flavored cereal</em> (Brand A, 12.5 oz, Gluten Free).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4jahN08plWt4bKJOI22Z3g.png" /><figcaption>Figure 8. Top recommendations from the engagement model</figcaption></figure><p>Therefore, we devise the final ranking as the combined result (ensemble) of the engagement and DL models. The engagement model assumes a higher weight in this ensemble when many replacement attempts exist for a given product pair (source product, candidate product). The hyperparameters <em>k</em> and <em>b</em> are fine-tuned to optimize the offline metrics previously discussed in the ranking section.</p><pre>final_score = engagement_model_score * weight + cold_start_model_score * (1-weight) <br /><br />weight = sigmoid (k * num_replacement_attempts + b)</pre><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WgEr8MV6x53T5GUiIZYAxQ.png" /><figcaption>Figure 9. Distribution of weight vs number of replacement attempts</figcaption></figure><p>Figure 9 reveals the weight distribution versus the number of replacement attempts for the optimal set of hyperparameters. The deep learning model dictates the final score for lower replacement attempt values. However, as the attempt numbers increase, the ensemble algorithm assigns greater weight to the engagement score. In this manner, we reap the benefits of both systems. After a fair number of replacement attempts (say, 400), the weight saturates to a value close to 1. Figure 10 shows the final ranking for our <em>Honey flavored cereal</em> example.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6pQS4VNQCk3-61SL0_oQ8g.png" /><figcaption>Figure 10. Top recommendations from the ensemble model</figcaption></figure><h3>Part 3: Updating the schema: optimizing for retailer-specific inventory</h3><p>The Instacart replacements model traditionally follows a (source_product_id, replacement_product_id) schema. However, this has frequently led to issues related to customer satisfaction and the relevance of the recommendations. Since this schema compelled a single ranking system across all retailers, it disregarded the distinct selections available at individual retailers. This design precipitated some noteworthy problems where the model has an inherent bias towards universally available products across all retailers instead of focusing on what each unique retailer can provide. For instance, because brand-name products represent a shared offering across multiple retailers, they get unjustly prioritized over store brands (exclusive to single retailers). This can give rise to customer complaints about pricing, where customers object to being charged more for replacements than the original products.</p><p>We made our replacements model retailer-aware to address these issues and changed the schema to (retailer_id, source_product_id, replacement_product_id). At the same time, we enhanced the underlying engagement model to calculate retailer-aware approval rates based on previous user engagement specific to different retailers. This change significantly boosted our replacement model’s precision, making customers more likely to see store brands as the top replacement suggestions. Thanks to retailer awareness, more user-selected replacements were available when Instacart shoppers went to fulfill the orders. Statistically significant improvements in metrics like <em>replacement_issues_per_delivery</em> were verified by an online A/B test before launch.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AXzukuDVPDykRWKMXxLOCw.png" /><figcaption>Figure 11. Ranking improvements due to retailer-aware replacement model</figcaption></figure><h3>Conclusion and Future Work</h3><p>Product replacements are a unique challenge in providing the best online grocery shopping experience. Our mission is to create a system that bridges the unpredictable retailer inventory, individual shopper decisions, and specific customer preferences — a challenge we tackle using deep learning methodologies, engagement, and detailed awareness of customers’ experiences.</p><p>So, what does all of this mean for our valued Instacart users? Whether you’re planning a dinner party, restocking your pantry, or craving your favorite snack, we’ve massively evolved our replacement recommendations, tackling all the guesswork and unpredictability. In the future, we plan to enhance the retrieval stage by utilizing our extensive catalog data, which includes image-based signals. We also aim to refine our ranking model by unifying engagement data and deep learning architecture, incorporating long-term customer preferences and session-based signals. These advancements will create a seamless and personalized shopping experience tailored to each user’s needs.</p><p>Want to learn more about how we use technology to enhance your shopping experience?

            <p><span class="company">tech-at-instacart - Medium</span>: <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ONO9MhfCYVSOMg5zWHlvtg.png" /></figure><p><strong>Authors</strong>: Pradeep Karuturi, Young Rao, Sharath Rao, Shishir Kumar Prasad<br /><strong>Key contributors</strong>: Brian Lin, Cheng Jia, Karuna Ahuja, Shrikar Archak, Jichao Zhang, Taesik Na, Haixun Wang</p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>At Instacart, we help our users find their favorite products organically or discover new ones through Ads across various shopping surfaces such as search, browse and recommendations. Behind the scenes, we use machine learning algorithms to power these surfaces to provide a delightful user experience. Each of these surfaces have diverse optimization goals and multi-step ranking pipelines (retrieval, ranking, re-ranking). For example, while organic content is often optimized for user engagement and transaction revenue, sponsored content additionally takes into consideration advertiser value and ad revenue. In this blogpost, we describe how we built a centralized <strong>contextual retrieval system</strong> that powers diverse recommendation surfaces, even though their end goals and ranking layers are different. Having a common retrieval system across both ads and organic surfaces has lowered our maintenance costs and allowed us to deprecate many legacy ad hoc retrieval systems. Using in-session contextual signals, we built a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a>-like language model to power sequence recommendations for this system.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/806/0*-TU_cH6cEyM_R0dX" /></figure><p>Our customers use Instacart for the convenience and time-savings we provide and often choose to fulfill the weekly shopping needs of their entire family by placing large basket orders. We take pride in making their shopping experience as efficient and effortless as possible. Our contextual retrieval system reacts in real time to a user’s actions within a shopping session and retrieves products relevant to that session. For example, when a user adds pancake mix to their cart, views bacon and later adds eggs to their cart, there is probably a breakfast intent and our contextual recommendation system will retrieve breakfast products as shown in the below diagram:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*GRWvjJ3dVOwlDvna" /><figcaption>Contextual Recommendations</figcaption></figure><p>We use this contextual recommendation system across many surfaces at Instacart such as search, item details page, cart, pre-checkout and post-checkout recommendations. Below, we show a couple of visual examples of where this contextual recommendation system is used.</p><p><strong>Item Details Page: </strong>Here we show detailed information about a product. We introduced a carousel titled, “Items to add next” that is based on user actions within a shopping session (cart adds, product page views etc.). In this example, the user already had milk and bread in their cart. In the context of these cart products and current olive oil product, we make relevant recommendations.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ajXej8EGJX-ADKKa" /></figure><p><strong>Cart Page: </strong>Before a user checks out, we show cart recommendations in the cart details page.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ih1ci4sbzTn3cvSfc1cC9g.png" /></figure><h3>Problem Formulation</h3><p>We formulate the retrieval problem in terms of the next product prediction task. Given a sequence of products that the user interacted with, we predict the probabilities for products that the user may interact with next.</p><p>Predict p(Pᵢ| Pₜ₁,Pₜ₂…) for i in [1, N], where N is the size of the catalog i.e., we predict the probability of the next product given a sequence of user product interactions at times t1,t2,…</p><p>Once we predict the probabilities across all product ids, we pick the top K products based on predicted probabilities for further downstream ranking. We evaluate the models offline using Recall@K metric. This metric roughly gives us the percentage of times when the last token in the test sequence dataset is present in the top K predictions from the model. This metric indicates how effectively the model predicts which product a user might be interested in next.</p><h3>Model</h3><p>In order to train a model for this problem, we used the Masked Language Model (MLM) approach that is very common in the NLP domain. Prior work in this domain (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06690">BERT4Rec</a>, <a href="https://research.facebook.com/publications/transformers4rec-bridging-the-gap-between-nlp-and-sequential-session-based-recommendation/">Transformers4Rec</a>) showed good results using this approach to e-commerce datasets. But unlike BERT4Rec and Transformers4Rec, which show results on tens of thousands of products, our production models have an order of 10x more products. Moreover, our catalog has millions of products spread across multiple retailers.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*rBZwUAj6HaElfXkh" /></figure><p>In the case of BERT, the model is trained on token sequences of text data. We train our model on historical sequences of product ids that a user interacts with in a session. At training time, we use a Masked Language Modeling(MLM) approach. At inference time, we use the encoded session representation from the transformer block to predict probabilities over all product ids. We tried different Language model architectures like XLNet and BERT, and based on offline evaluation we converged on a simple BERT-like model for our problem.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*T4SN5x3Qb7TpBHWdLwne7A.png" /><figcaption>Typical BERT model vs our use case</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*PepszTHnqaJEic6a" /></figure><p>Just using product ID sequences without any additional user or product features has shown significant impact and we limit ourselves to describing a preliminary version of this system that does not use any other features. We will follow up in a later post on how we leverage more contextual features in this system.</p><h3>Impact</h3><p>Prior to building this contextual retrieval system, we had a disparate set of retrieval systems for different recommendation surfaces across ads and organic surfaces. By leveraging a unified retrieval system, we were able to deprecate old ad hoc systems.</p><p>Prior retrieval systems did not properly use contextual sequence information and were mostly based on an ad-hoc combination of product co-occurrence, similarity and popularity signals; all of these are important but the next product purchase prediction turns out to be a principled path forward as well as empirically more successful. Our initial offline evaluation showed a significant uplift over prior systems and led to outsized impact across multiple metrics across transaction volume and ad marketplace. We also saw a 30% lift in user cart additions when we launched this system on cart recommendations.</p><h3>Discussion: Does sequence information matter?</h3><p>We have seen big wins from sequence based models at Instacart. But how significant is the precise sequence information in predicting user behavior? In other words, what happens if we mask the real sequence information and just input a group of products to the model? We evaluated this using two approaches:</p><h4>Different Training procedure</h4><p>When training a transformer-based sequence model, we randomized the tokens in the training sequences and saw how offline metrics are affected compared to that of our control model, which has access to precise sequence information. In the control model, we did not randomize token sequences in training data. We then compared the relevance metrics on non-randomized test dataset on the last product prediction task.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*E1XC6lphE22CoV4_" /><figcaption>Evaluating the importance of sequence information</figcaption></figure><p>Even though we may have gotten meaningful recommendations with completely randomized sequence training data, the relevance metrics (Recall@K) for the model trained on randomized training data were 10–40% worse depending on K. This indicates that sequence information at training has a meaningful impact on the quality of next product predictions.</p><h4>Different evaluation</h4><p>For a different evaluation, we kept the control model as-is at training time and changed the evaluation methodology. We got relevance metrics for the test dataset once by randomizing the token sequence in the test set and once without randomization. We kept the last product of the product sequence in the test data set and randomly shuffled all the products preceding the last product in the sequence. Evaluation metrics degraded by 20–45% depending on the value of K. This indicates that during model inference, if we do not have proper sequence information, prediction quality(and recommendations) will suffer.</p><p>We also evaluated the impact of more recent products in the user interaction sequence on recommendations. The last 3–5 products in the sequence have an outsized influence on the recommendations with prior products having a diminishing influence as the sequence length increases. So in practice, we resorted to using sequence length of 20 for training and inference.</p><h3>Ongoing and Future work</h3><p>We have described a preliminary contextual retrieval system, on which we have since iterated to tackle the challenges of applying language models to our use cases, including:</p><ol><li><strong>Catalog Size: </strong>Our catalog has millions of products spread across thousands of retailers. For the first iteration of our system, we restricted our models to have a product-id vocabulary of under one million. We choose these products based on a combination of product popularity and other business rules. Since we restrict the model vocabulary to be a fixed number, all the product_ids not in the datasets will be mapped to an Out of Vocabulary Token (OOV). We have explored ANN approaches to scale our model to millions of products.</li><li><strong>Canonical Product Identity: </strong>Millions of products are sold at Instacart across thousands of different retailers. Some of the products share a common identity across retailers, but some products, such as non-branded strawberries, may not share a common product identity. Since our preliminary model is just based on a sequence of product-IDs, it is possible that non-popular product-IDs (e.g., non-branded produce) may not surface in the recommendations even though such products are popular at a particular retailer. Text-content inclusive approaches, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05065">TiGER</a>, can help solve these problems.</li><li><strong>Popularity bias: </strong>As is commonly the case with retail — both online and offline — the majority of our user interaction data is with a small subset of our catalog and our training data reflects this. The preliminary model has a bias towards popular products when recommending products. So we get top-K products from the model for a particular retailer.</li><li><strong>More Context: </strong>So far we have focused our model training and inference using cart add and product view sequences. We are working on incorporating more context information such as user searches into our model.</li></ol><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Implementing transformer-based sequence models in our contextual retrieval layer has significantly enhanced the performance of our recommendation surfaces. Leveraging user interaction sequences has enabled us to develop more effective models than previous ones. Furthermore, by adopting a unified retrieval layer that serves both ads and organic surfaces, we have been able to phase out legacy systems that didn’t utilize sequential information. We have discovered that a simple BERT-like architecture is optimal for our datasets when focusing solely on product-ID sequences. Upcoming blog posts will delve into incorporating additional context and product and user features into our sequence models.</p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=93414a28e70c" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://tech.instacart.com/sequence-models-for-contextual-recommendations-at-instacart-93414a28e70c">Sequence models for Contextual Recommendations at Instacart</a> was originally published in <a href="https://tech.instacart.com">tech-at-instacart</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p></p>

At Instacart, search addresses multiple customer needs within our four-sided marketplace. Over the years, we have significantly improved the quality of our search results through sophisticated <a href="https://www.instacart.com/company/how-its-made/how-instacart-uses-embeddings-to-improve-search-relevance/">models</a> that understand user intent, retrieve highly relevant results, and optimally rank these results to <a href="https://tech.instacart.com/using-contextual-bandit-models-in-large-action-spaces-at-instacart-cb7ab4d8fa4f">balance</a> various business objectives.</p><p>Despite significant improvements in search result quality, our user research revealed that, alongside highly relevant results, users also wanted to see inspirational and discovery-driven content. This will help them find products that enable them to efficiently achieve their grocery tasks, whether it’s planning quick and healthy meals, or just discovering new products they have not tried before. Imagine stumbling upon a trendy snack that you didn’t search for but suddenly can’t live without! This approach doesn’t just serve our users; it also benefits the Instacart platform and CPG brands by showcasing new and relevant products.</p><p>In this blog post, we will discuss how we incorporated LLMs into the search stack to address this challenge. By integrating the extensive world knowledge of LLMs with Instacart’s domain-specific data about our users and catalog, we were able to enhance our content generation capabilities significantly. This combination allowed us to better expand the results set in Search to include related inspirational content, and ensure that the results were both relevant and engaging. These efforts have led to substantial improvements in user engagement and revenue.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5-_6Dbk5FxINF51VqalFXA.png" /></figure><h3>Limitations of our Pre-LLM approaches</h3><p>For most queries, our Search results page is organized into two sections</p><p><strong>Top Section:</strong> This section features products that are highly relevant to the user’s query and directly match their intent.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yxMivxS06JA7CpIn57yPSA.png" /><figcaption>Top section</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Related Items Section:</strong> Positioned below the top section, this area displays products similar to the user’s query but not as precisely targeted. These items are matched using broader keywords or related categories, offering users additional options that might still be of interest.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KVRIQ37zYIshSKMPmqkxKg.png" /><figcaption>Related items section</figcaption></figure><p>While the Related Items section provided opportunities for discovery, our strategies for retrieving products for this area were limited. For instance, in a query with narrow intent like “croissant,” if no exact matches were found in the store, we returned less relevant alternatives such as “cookies” simply because they belong to the same department as the original search intent.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*48YwrWOGsP2oEaIMFI01NQ.jpeg" /></figure><p>Even if users found what they were searching for at the top, scrolling down did not effectively address follow-up intents. For example, although we could recall a great match for a query like “vegan burger,” we failed to suggest complementary products that would pair well with it.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/884/1*Pqw7sQuTTlDnuLLDN3Fgwg.png" /></figure><p>These limitations drove us to explore LLMs to better understand user intent and improve product discovery.</p><h3>Advantages of LLMs</h3><p><strong>Rich world knowledge:</strong> LLMs have the ability to produce expert-like answers on common world concepts. This lets Search be so much more smarter on real world concepts without needing to invest in building large knowledge graphs. For example, an LLM can understand the nuances of different cuisines, providing contextually rich search results that improve user satisfaction. This was particularly advantageous for augmenting search results with Discovery oriented content. This results in reducing complex engineering efforts, lower costs and faster development cycles, enabling quicker adaptation to user needs without extensive resource investment.</p><p><strong>Easy to debug:</strong> Understanding why conventional NLP models make inaccurate predictions can be challenging. In contrast, with an LLM, one can generate its reasoning process to understand the rationale behind its predictions. This transparency allows developers to quickly identify and correct errors by adjusting the prompt accordingly, leading to a faster evaluation cycle and more reliable enhancements.</p><p>In the following sections, we provide details about how we integrated LLMs into our search stack by combining the world knowledge of LLMs with Instacart’s domain knowledge about our users and catalog.</p><h3>Generating Discovery-oriented Content</h3><p>Last year, our team pioneered the usage of LLMs in Search through the <a href="https://www.instacart.com/company/updates/bringing-inspirational-ai-powered-search-to-the-instacart-app-with-ask-instacart/">Ask Instacart</a> feature to handle natural language-style queries, such as “healthy low sugar snacks for a 3 year old” or broad queries like “birthday” as shown below.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/888/1*XxlbhCSR0IFYc7MPG9BL4Q.png" /><figcaption>Ask Instacart</figcaption></figure><p>Encouraged by the success of “Ask Instacart,” we began to explore questions such as: “How can we use LLMs to enhance search results for all queries, not just broad intent ones?” “Can we improve the explainability of recommendations in the ‘Related Items’ section?” and “Can we generate incremental revenue from the new content we display to users?” These inquiries led us to explore new methods for generating discovery-oriented content.</p><h3>Requirements for Content Generation</h3><p>We first set out to define the requirements for content generation.</p><ol><li><strong>Incremental Value:</strong> LLM-generated content should provide incremental value to the users. We should display products beyond what our current search engine is capable of retrieving and avoid duplication with existing results.</li><li><strong>Domain awareness:</strong> It should also be consistent with what a user searching on Instacart expects to see. For example, the LLM should understand that a query like ‘dishes ‘ generally refers to “cookware,” not “food,” while “thanksgiving dishes” refers more to food. Additionally, the lack of Instacart-specific knowledge in the LLM can mean it may not recognize queries related to more recent brands or retailers on Instacart. Ideally, we should be able to fuse the Instacart-specific context with the LLM’s world knowledge to generate relevant results.</li></ol><h3>Content Generation Techniques</h3><p>With the above requirements in mind we implemented two unique techniques that use LLMs to generate discovery oriented content:</p><ol><li>A <strong>Basic Generation technique</strong> involves giving the user’s query to an LLM and instructing it to generate discovery-oriented content.</li><li>An <strong>Advanced Generation technique</strong> enhances this by providing additional signals, such as data from query understanding models, historical product conversions, and search logs, to offer the LLM more context specific to Instacart’s domain.</li></ol><p>The response from LLM is parsed and mapped to relevant products in our catalog.</p><p>Using these techniques we generated two types of content:</p><ol><li>High quality <strong>complementary results</strong> which improved the number of products added to cart per search. Below we show an example of how we present complementary products like soy sauce and rice vinegar that pair well with the search query “sushi”. These products are presented as a carousel titled ‘Asian Cooking Ingredients,’ encouraging users to explore authentic ways to enhance their sushi meal experience. The carousel titles are also generated using LLMs.</li></ol><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/802/1*_9irjkUD-UpeEgqEo71Ckw.png" /></figure><p>2. Highly relevant <strong>substitute results</strong> for searches with no or low number of results that directly matched the query intent. Below we show an example of how we present substitute products for the search query ‘swordfish’: when there are no results that directly match the query intent, we offer alternative options like tilapia, salmon, or mahi-mahi. These substitutes are displayed with clear titles, to guide users towards satisfying alternatives for their culinary needs.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*KFDv6xaYPB7K230L" /></figure><p>Let us dive into more details about these generation techniques</p><h3>Basic Generation</h3><p>The basic generation technique involves instructing the LLM to act as an AI assistant for an online grocery shopping platform. The LLM’s task is to take a user’s search query and create shopping lists of substitute and complementary items that pair well with the search term. The prompt includes specific and detailed product requirements to define the desired output, along with hand-curated examples (few-shot prompting). We also ask the LLM to provide a brief explanation for its choices to enhance user understanding. After the LLM generates a response, we remove any redundant content to ensure clarity and conciseness.</p><p>Below is a condensed version of the prompt</p><pre>As an AI assistant, you aid with online grocery shopping. You generate search <br />queries for ecommerce platforms like Instacart, according to user query.<br />You will first generate 3 shopping lists, each with 5 items. The 3 lists are:<br />1. substitute items; <br />2. complementary/bought-together product group that goes well with the search term; <br />3. another complementary/bought-together list with a different product group<br /><br />For the two complementary lists, consider the following groups as examples: <br />Cooking Ingredients (such as Spices and herbs, Cooking oils, Sauces and condiments), Side Dishes, Accompaniments, Proteins, Beverages, Desserts, Snacks, Cooking Equipment.<br /><br />But don't constrain yourself with those listed groups, be creative. <br />Accompany each complementary list with a reason such as &quot;Cooking Equipment&quot;. <br /><br />Your recommendations in each list should: <br />- Be general, covering various products available at stores like Kroger, Publics, Wegmans, Safeway, or Walmart. <br />- For a query like 'birthday party planning', suggest 'cakes', 'snacks', 'desserts', 'party supplies', 'party decorations' rather than specific products.<br />- Keep the list to a single concept. Instead of 'shrimp fried rice' or 'bbq pork fried rice', simply use 'fried rice'.<br />- Avoid further details in parentheses.<br />- Be creative in complementary, bought-together, and higher-level-theme shopping lists.<br /><br />Here a few examples<br />&quot;query&quot;: &quot;ice cream&quot;<br />&quot;content&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;{<br />  &quot;a&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Substitute&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Other frozen treats&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Frozen Yogurt&quot;, &quot;Gelato&quot;, &quot;Sorbet&quot;, &quot;Sherbet&quot;, &quot;Frozen Custard&quot;]}, <br />  &quot;b&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Complementary&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Toppings and sauces&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Hot Fudge Sauce&quot;, &quot;Caramel Sauce&quot;, &quot;Whipped Cream&quot;, &quot;Sprinkles&quot;, &quot;Chopped Nuts&quot;]}, <br />  &quot;c&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Complementary&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Sweet snacks&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Cookies&quot;, &quot;Brownies&quot;, &quot;Waffle Cones&quot;, &quot;Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Bites&quot;, &quot;Candy Bars&quot;]}, <br />  &quot;d&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Theme&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Indulgent Frozen Treats&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Gourmet Ice Cream&quot;, &quot;Ice Cream Sandwiches&quot;, &quot;Ice Cream Cake&quot;, &quot;Frozen Cheesecake&quot;, &quot;Milkshakes&quot;]}, <br />  &quot;e&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Theme&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Dessert Cravings&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Chocolate Lava Cake&quot;, &quot;Apple Pie&quot;, &quot;Creme Brulee&quot;, &quot;Tiramisu&quot;, &quot;Fruit Tart&quot;]}, <br />  &quot;f&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Theme&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Sweet Summer Delights&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Popsicles&quot;, &quot;Frozen Fruit Bars&quot;, &quot;Sorbetto&quot;, &quot;Ice Cream Floats&quot;, &quot;Frozen Lemonade&quot;]}<br />}&quot;&quot;&quot;},<br /><br />&quot;query&quot;: &quot;ice cream&quot;<br />&quot;content&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;{<br />  &quot;a&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Substitute&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Other frozen meals&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Frozen Burritos&quot;, &quot;Frozen Chicken Nuggets&quot;, &quot;Frozen French Fries&quot;, &quot;Frozen Mozzarella Sticks&quot;, &quot;Frozen Chicken Wings&quot;]}, <br />  &quot;b&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Complementary&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Side dishes&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Garlic Bread&quot;, &quot;Caesar Salad&quot;, &quot;Mozzarella sticks&quot;, &quot;Frozen Breadsticks&quot;, &quot;Frozen Meatballs&quot;]}, <br />  &quot;c&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Complementary&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Desserts&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Brownies&quot;, &quot;Ice cream&quot;, &quot;Fruit salad&quot;, &quot;Churros&quot;, &quot;Cheesecake&quot;]}, <br />  &quot;d&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Theme&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Quick and Easy Dinners&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Frozen Lasagna&quot;, &quot;Frozen Chicken Alfredo&quot;, &quot;Frozen Mac and Cheese&quot;, &quot;Frozen Chicken Pot Pie&quot;, &quot;Frozen Beef Enchiladas&quot;]}, <br />  &quot;e&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Theme&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Convenient Frozen Meals&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Frozen Chicken Teriyaki&quot;, &quot;Frozen Beef Stir Fry&quot;, &quot;Frozen Shrimp Scampi&quot;, &quot;Frozen Vegetable Fried Rice&quot;, &quot;Frozen Chicken Parmesan&quot;]}, <br />  &quot;f&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Theme&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Pizza Night at Home&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Pizza Dough Mix&quot;, &quot;Pizza Sauce&quot;, &quot;Shredded Mozzarella Cheese&quot;, &quot;Pepperoni Slices&quot;, &quot;Sliced Black Olives&quot;]}<br />}&quot;&quot;&quot;},<br /><br />Return the output in a valid json format.

Specifically, we found many examples where the LLM misinterpreted the user’s intent and generated recommendations that were too generic. For example, when users searched for ‘Just Mayo,’ a brand of vegan mayonnaise, LLM misinterpreted the intent and suggested generic mayonnaise substitutes or recipes. Similarly, for the query ‘protein,’ the system initially recommended common protein sources such as beef, chicken, pork, or tofu. However, our data indicated that users frequently converted on categories like ‘Protein Bars’ and ‘Protein Powders.’ Consequently, our users did not find these generic suggestions very relevant, resulting in poor engagement.</p><p><strong>Augmenting the LLM prompt with domain knowledge</strong></p><p>To address these issues, we augmented the basic LLM prompt described in the previous section with signals from our Query Understanding models, and historical engagement data. More specifically, the prompt included annotations to help the LLM accurately understand the query intent, like whether the query contained the name of a brand or an attribute like “frozen,” and the most popular categories that users converted on for this query. This steered the LLM to generate recommendations that are more aligned with user needs and preferences, ensuring that the results were not only relevant but also reflective of real user behavior.</p><p>Here is a condensed version of the new prompt to illustrate the change</p><pre>As an AI assistant, you help with online grocery shopping. You generate search <br />queries for ecommerce platforms like Instacart, utilizing the following <br />info.<br />1. user query. 2. previous purchased categories. 3. query annotations. <br />Annotations help you accurately understand query intent, where &lt;P&gt; means <br />product concept, &lt;B&gt; means brand name, &lt;A&gt; means attributes.<br /><br />Below are some examples<br /><br />My query is &quot;body armor&quot;, it has an annotation as &quot;&lt;B&gt;:BODYARMOR&quot;. From the<br />results of this category, I previously purchased these product categories<br />&quot;Sports Drinks&quot;, &quot;Flavored or Infused Waters&quot;<br />&quot;content&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;{<br />   &quot;a&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Substitute&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Other brands&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Gatorade&quot;, &quot;Powerade&quot;, &quot;Propel&quot;, &quot;Vitaminwater&quot;, &quot;Nuun&quot;]},<br />   &quot;b&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Complementary&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Workout snacks&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Protein Bars&quot;, &quot;Energy Gels&quot;, &quot;Trail Mix&quot;, &quot;Bananas&quot;, &quot;Granola Bars&quot;]},<br />   &quot;c&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Complementary&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Fitness accessories&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Water Bottle&quot;, &quot;Towel&quot;, &quot;Resistance Bands&quot;, &quot;Yoga Mat&quot;, &quot;Jump Rope&quot;]},<br />   &quot;d&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Theme&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Sports Drinks&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Gatorade&quot;, &quot;Powerade&quot;, &quot;Propel&quot;, &quot;Vitaminwater&quot;, &quot;Nuun&quot;]},<br />   &quot;e&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Theme&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Hydration for Workouts&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Electrolyte Tablets&quot;, &quot;Coconut Water&quot;, &quot;Sports Drink Powder&quot;, &quot;Hydro Flask&quot;, &quot;Recovery Drink&quot;]},<br />   &quot;f&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Theme&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Electrolyte Replenishment&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Pedialyte&quot;, &quot;Coconut Water&quot;, &quot;Electrolyte Water&quot;, &quot;Sports Drink Mix&quot;, &quot;Electrolyte Gel&quot;]}<br />}&quot;&quot;&quot;},<br /><br />My query is &quot;frozen pizza&quot;, it has an annotation as &quot;&lt;P&gt;:pizza, &lt;A&gt;:frozen&quot;.<br />From the results of this category, I previously purchased these product<br />categories &quot;Frozen Pizzas&quot;, &quot;Frozen Pizza Snacks&quot;<br />&quot;content&quot;: &quot;&quot;&quot;{<br />  &quot;a&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Substitute&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Other frozen meals&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Frozen Burritos&quot;, &quot;Frozen Chicken Nuggets&quot;, &quot;Frozen French Fries&quot;, &quot;Frozen Mozzarella Sticks&quot;, &quot;Frozen Chicken Wings&quot;]},<br />  &quot;b&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Complementary&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Side dishes&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Garlic Bread&quot;, &quot;Caesar Salad&quot;, &quot;Mozzarella sticks&quot;, &quot;Frozen Breadsticks&quot;, &quot;Frozen Meatballs&quot;]},<br />  &quot;c&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Complementary&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Desserts&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Brownies&quot;, &quot;Ice cream&quot;, &quot;Fruit salad&quot;, &quot;Churros&quot;, &quot;Cheesecake&quot;]},<br />  &quot;d&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Theme&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Quick and Easy Dinners&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Frozen Lasagna&quot;, &quot;Frozen Chicken Alfredo&quot;, &quot;Frozen Mac and Cheese&quot;, &quot;Frozen Chicken Pot Pie&quot;, &quot;Frozen Beef Enchiladas&quot;]},<br />  &quot;e&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Theme&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Convenient Frozen Meals&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Frozen Chicken Teriyaki&quot;, &quot;Frozen Beef Stir Fry&quot;, &quot;Frozen Shrimp Scampi&quot;, &quot;Frozen Vegetable Fried Rice&quot;, &quot;Frozen Chicken Parmesan&quot;]},<br />  &quot;f&quot;: {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;Theme&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Pizza Night at Home&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;Pizza Dough Mix&quot;, &quot;Pizza Sauce&quot;, &quot;Shredded Mozzarella Cheese&quot;, &quot;Pepperoni Slices&quot;, &quot;Sliced Black Olives&quot;]}<br />}&quot;&quot;&quot;}<br /><br />My query is &quot;protein&quot;. From the results of this category, I previously <br />purchased product categories like &quot;Protein Bars&quot;, &quot;Protein Shakes&quot; <br />&quot;Protein Powders' and &quot;Plant-Based Protein Snacks&quot;.</pre><p>This fusion enhanced the LLM’s ability to distinguish between different interpretations of a query, significantly improving the accuracy and relevance of the recommendations. For example, for the query “protein”, the LLM was able to recommend a carousel titled “<strong>Lean Protein Essentials</strong>” that contains products like cheese, peanut butter and yogurt. Such a carousel effectively catered to users interested in diversifying their protein intake with both traditional and snack-like options, complementing their previous interests in protein bars, shakes, powders, and snacks.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*B1uUbuqydGYhH8hlV7yv8Q.jpeg" /></figure><p>This approach was critical in delivering personalized and effective recommendations that resonate with user preferences. As a result, we saw notable boosts in user engagement and revenue.</p><p><strong>Limitations</strong></p><p>While the above approach to content generation is effective, augmenting LLM knowledge with user engagement data, it has a notable limitation: the context provided to the LLM is still restrictive, as it is bound by the products that users engage with for the current query. For instance, when users search for “sour cream,” the inputs to the LLM rely solely on the products users engage with, such as popular sour cream brands, without considering what users typically purchase afterward, like tortilla chips or baked potatoes. This omission introduces a bias that limits the potential for generating truly inspirational and comprehensive content.</p><p>To address this, we implemented an innovative extension to generate additional content: utilizing the next converted search terms to inform content generation. By understanding what users frequently buy following their initial “sour cream” purchase, we provide a richer, more varied context. This method allows us to capture a broader range of user interests and identify complementary items more accurately. By analyzing the sequence of items added to carts, we can predict the most likely products to follow for a given query. This data informs the LLM, which then categorizes these sequences and provides deeper insights into customers’ purchasing motivations. Our online experiments showed that this methodology led to an 18% improvement in engagement rate with the inspirational content.</p><p>Below is an example prompt for the query “sour cream”</p><pre>You are an AI shopping assistant for a grocery search engine like Instacart. <br />here are the items and their respective frequencies that customers often bought<br />after purchasing &quot;sour cream&quot;, <br /><br />Can you provide suggestions on how we can improve the merchandising of these <br />items by categorizing them more effectively? Please also explain your <br />reasoning behind these suggestions. use json format.<br /><br />shredded cheese 16004<br />cream cheese 13008<br />salsa 10564<br />butter 8108<br />cheese 7599<br />milk 7305<br />eggs 7109<br />lettuce 6307<br />……</pre><p>Below we show the results of the recommendations generated by the LLM for the query “salsa”</p><pre>{<br />  &quot;Mexican Fiesta Essentials&quot;: {<br />    &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;salsa&quot;, &quot;taco seasoning&quot;, &quot;chips&quot;, &quot;guacamole&quot;, &quot;mexican cheese&quot;, &quot;tortillas&quot;, &quot;taco sauce&quot;, &quot;tortilla chips&quot;, &quot;refried beans&quot;, &quot;taco shells&quot;, &quot;black beans&quot;, &quot;tortilla chip&quot;],<br />    &quot;suggestion&quot;: &quot;Group all Mexican food ingredients together.

These are often used in the same recipes as sour cream. Consider offering recipe suggestions that include these items and sour cream.&quot;<br />  },<br />  &quot;Meat and Poultry&quot;: {<br />    &quot;items&quot;: [&quot;ground beef&quot;, &quot;bacon&quot;, &quot;chicken breast&quot;],<br />    &quot;suggestion&quot;: &quot;Group all meat and poultry items together. These items are often used in meals with sour cream. Consider offering meal suggestions or recipe cards that include these items.&quot;<br />  }<br />}</pre><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/836/1*VJSWYiuNoqOn1xJcFnbYoA.png" /></figure><p>Implementing this approach wasn’t straightforward. Particularly, while product search sequence data provides valuable insights into user shopping behavior it can also be quite noisy, often reflecting partial or varied user needs — in one session, a customer might search for dental floss followed by tomatoes. To address this challenge, we mine the data for frequently co-occurring lists of consecutive search terms. By focusing on these patterns, we extract high-quality signals that serve as context for LLMs to generate a diverse set of recommendation bundles.</p><h3>Data pipeline</h3><p>To optimize latency and costs, we generate the content offline, allowing for additional post-processing. We perform the following steps in an offline process:</p><ol><li><strong>Data Preparation</strong>: We run a batch job to extract search queries issued by our users from historical logs, and enrich with the necessary metadata like QU signals, consecutive search terms and any other signals that are required for implementing the techniques that we described above.</li><li><strong>LLM prompt generation</strong>: We use a predefined prompt template as a base structure. For each historical query, we populate this template with the enriched query and its associated metadata. This process creates a unique, contextually-rich prompt tailored to each specific query.</li><li><strong>LLM response generation</strong>: We run a batch job to invoke the LLM and store its response in a key value store. The key is the query and the value is the LLM response containing the substitute and complementary recommendations. For example:</li></ol><pre>&quot;crab&quot;: {<br />    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Seafood Seasonings&quot;,<br />    &quot;items&quot;: [<br />        &quot;Cajun Seasoning&quot;,        <br />        &quot;Old Bay Seasoning&quot;,<br />        &quot;Lemon Pepper Seasoning&quot;,<br />        &quot;Garlic Butter Seasoning&quot;<br />    ]<br />}</pre><p>4. <strong>LLM response to Product mapping</strong>: In the next step, we take each item in the list generated above, treat it like a search query, and invoke our existing search engine to get the best product matches for the query. For example, our search engine returns products like “Louisiana Hot Sauce Cajun Seasoning” for the query “cajun seasoning”.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*SDxIaZqeSD9NpjpUQsHkMw.png" /></figure><p>We now store these mappings of Query -&gt; LLM response -&gt; Products in an LLM-content table. This data is refreshed daily to ensure freshness.</p><p>5. <strong>Post-processing</strong>: We perform post processing steps to remove duplicates or similar products, and remove any irrelevant products that could have been recalled. We use a diversity based reranking algorithm to ensure that users can see a variety of options. The final output is written back into the LLM-content table.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VAvDG623U0ZPMDJ7f8itjg.jpeg" /></figure><p>6. <strong>Serving the content at runtime</strong>: When a user issues a query on our app, along with recalling the usual search results, we also look up the LLM-content table and display the inspirational products in a carousel with suitable titles. Below is an example, where we suggest “Autumn Harvest Roasting Kit” for the query “butternut squash”.</p><h3>Challenges that we solved</h3><p>We will discuss some key challenges that we solved to achieve success.</p><p><strong>Aligning generation with business goals:</strong> First, we focused on aligning the content generation with crucial business metrics such as revenue. By ensuring that the generated content not only meets user needs but also aligns with our revenue goals, we’ve created a more effective search experience that drives business growth.</p><p><strong>Content Ranking: </strong>Second, building specialized models to rank the generated content was essential to improving user engagement. By prioritizing the most relevant and engaging results, we enhance the user’s interaction with the platform, making it more likely they will find what they are looking for and explore additional products. Furthermore, an increased amount of content on the page led to a cluttered interface and added operational complexity. To tackle this issue, we developed a<strong> Whole Page Ranker</strong> model which determines the optimal positions for the new content on the page. The objective of the model is to ensure that we show highly relevant content to the users while also balancing revenue objectives. By dynamically adjusting the layout based on the content type and relevance, we could also present information more intuitively.</p><p><strong>Content Evaluation: </strong>We developed robust methods for content evaluation. This ensures the quality and relevance of the generated search results, maintaining high standards and continuously refining our approach based on user feedback and performance metrics. This was much more challenging and important than we initially expected. We realized early on that the conventional notion of relevance doesn’t directly apply to discovery-oriented content in search results. This is because traditional relevance metrics often focus on direct answers or matches to user queries, but discovery content aims to inspire and suggest related items that users may not have explicitly searched for but could still find useful. Also, with the large volume of searches and the diverse items available in our catalog, we had to develop robust, scalable methods to continuously assess and ensure the quality and relevance of the generated content. To address these challenges, we adopted the paradigm of using <strong>LLM as a Judge</strong> to evaluate the quality of the content. Below we provide a highly condensed version of the LLM prompt to illustrate how this works:</p><pre>As an expert in e-commerce recommendation systems for Instacart, your task is <br />to evaluate content curated by human curators. The curators take an input <br />search term and generate ideas for search terms that are either complementary <br />or substitute to the original term. These additional search terms will be used <br />to retrieve relevant items from the catalog and recommend them to the user. <br />The goal is to create the most inspiring search terms that will encourage <br />users to make a purchase. Please evaluate the content and provide a score to <br />judge its quality. </pre><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>The use of LLMs to generate discovery-oriented content has been pivotal in enhancing user engagement and boosting revenue. Navigating challenges such as aligning content generation with business goals, content ranking, and content evaluation was crucial, but we’ve seen clear benefits in our business metrics. However, the success of LLMs in our search stack extends beyond content generation. Stay tuned for our next post, where we’ll discuss how LLMs enhanced our Query understanding models.</p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=556c585d4720" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://tech.instacart.com/supercharging-discovery-in-search-with-llms-556c585d4720">Supercharging Discovery in Search with LLMs</a> was originally published in <a href="https://tech.instacart.com">tech-at-instacart</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p></p>

A critical component of any search engine is the recall layer which is used to retrieve the relevant documents for a given search query.</p><p>Recall in modern search stacks is driven primarily by two methods: text search and semantic (or embedding) search. Each method has its strengths when retrieving relevant documents: text search excels at keyword matching between query and document while semantic search shines at understanding the query context and intent. Typically, recall sets are constructed by independently fetching documents from each method and then independently merging the results.</p><p>While this approach scales well, it is generally suboptimal. In this blog post, we will explore the limitations of the current system and discuss how we built a hybrid search architecture that leveraged the concept of query entropy to jointly optimize the recall set generation across the different retrieval mechanisms. In a follow-up blog post, we will go into how we migrated to pgvector and the infrastructural changes we made to enable this architecture.</p><p>First let’s start with an overview of the current search retrieval architecture at Instacart and some of the challenges we face.</p><h3>Search retrieval at Instacart</h3><p>Instacart is a four-sided marketplace with multiple retailers across a wide range of verticals featured on the platform. As of Q4’ 2023, Instacart’s catalog had over 1.4 billion documents (items) served across 1500+ national, local and regional retailers. While these numbers are not massive at today’s ecommerce search scale, there are a number of challenges faced by the search retrieval layer due to the nature of the Instacart marketplace as discussed below.</p><h3>Challenges</h3><h4>Variability in query distribution</h4><p>The vast array of retailers leads to significant variance in search query distribution and the number of relevant documents per query. For instance, the query “tofu” yields over 100 results at 99 Ranch Market (retailer specializing in Asian groceries) but fewer than five at Costco, due to differing retailer offerings across locations. The query’s specificity also impacts the retrieval effectiveness, with text search suiting specific queries and semantic search aiding understanding in ambiguous cases.</p><h4>Over-fetching of documents</h4><p>Operating text and semantic retrieval mechanisms independently often results in a fixed number of items being retrieved from each source, regardless of the query or retailer. This approach is not only wasteful but also reduces precision, particularly when there are limited relevant items for a query.</p><h3>Recall Architecture</h3><p>In order to handle the above challenges, over the years, we tuned the two retrieval mechanisms independently to improve recall performance. Let’s dive deeper into each of these systems to understand the limitations with this approach.</p><h4>Text Retrieval with Postgres</h4><p>For text retrieval, we rely on Postgres and SQL queries are used to fetch relevant documents based on the query context.</p><ul><li><strong>Indexing</strong>: Documents are indexed using <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/gin-intro.html">GIN</a> indexes.</li><li><strong>Scoring</strong>: A customized term-frequency algorithm (<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-controls.html#TEXTSEARCH-RANKING">ts_rank</a>) scores documents based on their relevance to the query.</li><li><strong>Retrieval</strong>: The top Kt documents are fetched from Postgres based on these scores.</li></ul><h4>Semantic Retrieval with FAISS</h4><p>For semantic retrieval, we use an approximate-nearest neighbor (ANN) search service built using Facebook’s FAISS library. This method operates on vector embeddings, enabling efficient searches through vast document spaces with minimal recall accuracy tradeoff</p><ul><li><strong>Embeddings Generation</strong>: We use a bi-encoder model based on the <a href="http://minilm-l3-v2">Huggingface MiniLM-L3-v2</a> architecture to generate query and document embeddings. For more details on our embedding training and usage in search, you can refer to our detailed <a href="https://www.instacart.com/company/how-its-made/how-instacart-uses-embeddings-to-improve-search-relevance/">blogpost on embeddings</a>.</li><li><strong>Indexing</strong>: Document embeddings are indexed using FAISS.</li><li><strong>ANN Search</strong>: At runtime, the query embedding is passed to the ANN service. The top Ke relevant documents are then returned, ranked by the dot product scores of the query and document embeddings.</li></ul><p>At runtime, we make parallel requests to each of these indexes to retrieve the top relevant documents from each index. The top Ke retrieved documents from the semantic index are merged with the top Kt documents retrieved from the text index. The top K relevant products after merging these two lists are then passed down to the downstream ranking stages <a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*Fw9R_qrNyIRD8hwG">(Fig. 1)</a>.</p><p><em>recall set = top K [{Kt documents from text retrieval} ∪ {Ke documents from semantic retrieval}]</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/574/0*Fw9R_qrNyIRD8hwG" /><figcaption>Fig 1. Recall architecture</figcaption></figure><h3>Towards Adaptive Retrieval: Combining Text and Semantic Searches</h3><p>Our initial approach generated a fixed-size list of documents from each retrieval mechanism, without considering the specifics of each query. This naive merging and filtering method often proved suboptimal, as one retrieval mechanism might be better suited for a particular query. To enhance both recall and precision, we recognized the need to adapt the recall set contextually, based on the query and the retailer.</p><h3>Adaptive Recall Model:</h3><p>As a first step towards a more optimal retrieval strategy, we decided to build a model that would allow us to adaptively tune the recall set size from each retrieval mechanism based on the request context i.e. the query, retailer. To adaptively construct the ideal recall set, we turned to a query specificity model called query entropy.</p><h4>Query Entropy</h4><p>Query entropy measures the specificity of a query and models the variation or uncertainty in the number of relevant documents for that query.</p><p><em>query_entropy = -</em>Σ <em>P(doc_id | query) log</em>₂<em>P(doc_id | query)</em></p><p><em>where P(doc_id | query) = count(doc_id converted | query ) / count(query) and the sum is over all doc_ids retrieved for that query</em></p><p>Using query entropy allows our system to dynamically adjust the retrieval approach:</p><ul><li>For highly specific queries like “lucerne 2% low-fat milk”, the query entropy is low, indicating a small number of relevant results.</li><li>For broader queries like “snacks,” the query entropy is higher indicating a larger number of relevant items and consequently a larger recall set.</li></ul><p>To illustrate this concept better, Fig. 2 shows how the mean converting position (display position on the page at which a search ends in a purchase) varies as a function of query entropy.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*eG3zeTxuOT3lzG7Q" /><figcaption>Fig 2. Mean conversion position v/s query entropy</figcaption></figure><p>For higher entropy, the number of relevant results is higher and so users tend to scroll down more which results in a bigger mean converting position as entropy increases.</p><p>More importantly, the ratio of relevant items between text and embedding retrieval also varies by entropy, allowing us to adaptively determine the recall set size for each recall type based on the entropy.</p><h3>Adaptive recall set sizes</h3><p>Using the knowledge that the recall set size can be tuned as a function of the query entropy and recall type, we were able to tune the recall set size adaptively across different retailers and queries. This helped us to have a more relevant final recall set and also minimize the over-fetching problem. The recall threshold for each retrieval mechanism is determined using the equation below:</p><p><em>recall_threshold = min(M, max(L, M * query_product_entropy / Q))</em></p><p>where</p><ul><li>L is the minimum number of products to recall.</li><li>M is the maximum number of products to recall.</li><li>Q is the value to which we clip query product entropy.</li><li>query_product_entropy is the calculated entropy for the specific query.</li></ul><p>Fig 3 illustrates how the recall set size adapts as a function of entropy, with L=500, M=1000, and Q=10.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*7H8vuLKWkn6lnl43" /><figcaption>Fig 3. Recall set size as a function of entropy</figcaption></figure><p>To adaptively construct the ideal recall set, we follow these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Calculate Query Entropy</strong>: Determine the entropy value for the current query.</li><li><strong>Adjust Recall Thresholds</strong>: Adjust the recall thresholds for text and semantic retrieval mechanisms based on the calculated entropy.</li><li><strong>Retrieve and Combine Results</strong>: Fetch the documents from both retrieval mechanisms and combine them contextually to create a more relevant recall set.</li></ul><p>This adaptable approach optimizes the recall set distribution, improving relevance and reducing latency. It represents a significant step towards a more intelligent and efficient retrieval strategy, as reflected in improved search metrics such as mean converting position by 1.7% and reduced latency by 1.5%.</p><h3>Towards hybrid search</h3><p>While adjusting the recall set sizes based on the query and retrieval mechanism significantly improved recall set distribution and latency, there is more potential for enhancement. To further boost recall performance, we are working on merging the recall sets in a more integrated manner. This effort is a work in progress, and we will highlight some of the approaches we are currently exploring for generating optimal recall sets.</p><h3>Hybrid retrieval</h3><p>A fusion approach to merge the retrieval sets is the norm in current industry hybrid search architectures and a number of datastores have some built-in support for this. The method used to merge the recall sets can vary depending on whether the datastore supports traditional text matching algorithms like BM25 or sparse vectors. For example, <a href="https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/data/understanding-hybrid-search">Pinecone</a> and <a href="https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/hybrid-queries/">Qdrant</a> support hybrid retrieval of sparse and dense vectors while others like <a href="https://lancedb.github.io/lancedb/hybrid_search/hybrid_search/#hybrid-search-in-lancedb">LanceDB</a> support a customized retrieval function that combines semantic and text match scores.</p><p>In our platform, we are exploring a few different approaches of which a couple are listed below:</p><h4>Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF):</h4><ul><li>This non-parametric approach combines ranked lists with different ranking criteria.</li><li>The algorithm merges the lists using the reciprocal of the ranks of products.</li><li>For instance, if a product is ranked x in one list and y in another, its combined score is calculated as <em>(1/x + 1/y)</em>. These combined scores are then used to generate the final ranked list.</li></ul><h4>Convex Combination of scores:</h4><ul><li>This method uses a weighted combination of lexical and semantic scores for each product.</li><li>We compute global weights, w1 and w2, which determine the emphasis on each retrieval mechanism (lexical and semantic).</li><li>The weights can be adjusted based on the query and retailer context to further refine the recall.</li><li>The combined score for a product is calculated using the formula:</li></ul><p><em>document_score = w1 * lex_score + w2 * sem_score</em></p><h3><strong>Key takeaways from our efforts:</strong></h3><p>In our journey to enhance the search experience on Instacart, we have embarked on the path towards a truly hybrid recall architecture that intelligently combines the strengths of text-based retrieval with those of semantic (embedding) search. This initial step allows us to overcome significant challenges such as varying query distributions, retailer-specific item variations, and the inefficiencies of over-fetching documents.</p><p><strong>Adaptive Recall:</strong></p><ul><li>By leveraging query entropy, we have developed an adaptive system that tailors the recall sets based on the specificity of user queries.</li><li>This approach optimizes search relevance and minimizes over-fetching which lead to improvements in search metrics.</li></ul><p><strong>Towards a Fully Hybrid Search:</strong></p><ul><li>Our current work lays the foundation for a more optimal recall set generation.</li><li>Techniques such as Reciprocal Rank Fusion and Convex Combination of scores are set to further enhance the precision and relevance of the recall sets.</li></ul><p><strong>Infrastructure Improvements:</strong></p><ul><li>We are actively working on migrating our recall infrastructure from FAISS to pgvector. This migration will consolidate our recall mechanisms into a single document store and open new opportunities for optimizing recall.</li></ul><p>By bringing together these strategic enhancements, we are committed to delivering a superior search experience for our users, helping them find what they need quickly and efficiently.</p><p>Stay tuned for our upcoming blog posts where we will dive deeper into our migration from FAISS to pgvector and share our continued advancements in hybrid search.</p><p><strong>Acknowledgments</strong><br />This project required the collaboration of multiple teams across the company including ML, ML infra, backend and core infra teams to be realized.

If you missed it, be sure to have a look at our previous post <a href="https://tech.instacart.com/the-economics-team-at-instacart-94c48db951e8">introducing the Economics Team at Instacart</a> as well as two more applied posts: one on using <a href="https://tech.instacart.com/optimizing-at-the-edge-using-regression-discontinuity-designs-to-power-decision-making-51e296615046">regression discontinuity to optimize authorization buffers</a> and one on using <a href="https://tech.instacart.com/bandits-for-marketing-optimization-f5a63b9bfaa7">bandits for marketing optimization</a>.</p><p>In this post, we will focus on how we use surrogate indices to estimate long-run heterogeneous treatment effects of our membership incentive portfolio. This project was a collaboration with our colleague from the Growth Data Science team, Mack Sweeney.</p><h3>Membership Incentives at Instacart</h3><p>At Instacart, we have a paid membership program (<a href="https://www.instacart.com/store/account/instacart-plus">Instacart+</a>) that offers various benefits for members, including free delivery on orders of a certain size and access to exclusive partnership offers. To let users explore the benefits of membership, we offer incentives like free trials or discounted annual memberships to certain users.</p><p>What kinds of potential users should we give an incentive to and for how much? These questions are central to the success of this program. Our goal is to give membership discounts that maximize users’ long-term value (LTV) to Instacart, holding constant other business decisions.</p><p>Answering these questions requires addressing two important problems:</p><ol><li>Creating a metric that appropriately captures the LTV of a user</li><li>Building an algorithm that can learn how to make user-level discount decisions that optimize the above metric</li></ol><p>Below, we focus on how we use surrogates to tackle the first problem. In a later post, we will discuss how we use <a href="https://tech.instacart.com/using-contextual-bandit-models-in-large-action-spaces-at-instacart-cb7ab4d8fa4f">contextual bandits</a> and meta-learners to address the second problem.</p><h3>Surrogate Indices</h3><p>A <em>surrogate </em>is a proxy or placeholder for the true (unobserved) outcome of interest. The true outcome is unobserved, either because it hasn’t happened yet or because it has happened but we simply don’t have access to the data.</p><p>In industry, we are typically in the, “hasn’t happened yet” situation where we have lots of <em>contemporaneous </em>data on users, but need predictions of long-term effects.</p><p>For example, an e-commerce site might assume a linear relationship between the total user-level revenue over the month following a membership discount and the LTV of that user. By looking at the historical relationship between month 1 user revenue and LTV, the e-commerce company can estimate a “multiplier” (or coefficient) to map from monthly revenue to LTV:</p><p><em>LTV = multiplier x month 1 user revenue</em></p><p>Typically, e-commerce sites want to estimate the incremental LTV (iLTV) of a new incentive, i.e., the effect of the treatment on LTV. The same multiplier can be used for this. Simply estimate the month 1 user revenue <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Treatment%20Effects.pdf">treatment effect</a> (e.g., via an A/B test) and multiply:</p><p><em>iLTV = multiplier x month 1 user revenue </em><strong><em>treatment effect</em></strong>.</p><p>While this framework is straightforward, a single surrogate variable often has limitations. Suppose there are two growth initiatives. One encourages customers to place bigger orders (increasing monthly revenue while keeping orders fixed). The other encourages customers to order more frequently in exchange for temporary price reductions (reducing short-term revenue but increasing monthly orders). To have any hope of projecting the LTV of the two different initiatives, we need a surrogate that somehow controls for <em>both </em>short-term monthly orders <em>and </em>monthly revenue. To do this, we need a surrogate <em>index</em>!</p><p>A <em>surrogate index </em>is a mapping between multiple observed variables and an unobserved outcome of interest (see <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26463/w26463.pdf">Athey et al. 2019</a> for additional details). Typically, the observed variables are a combination of short-run post-treatment outcomes (such as the number of orders and total revenue over a single month) and pretreatment<em> </em>variables (such as the average revenue per month for a user prior to treatment). In this context, these short-run post-treatment outcomes are surrogates, hence the name surrogate index.</p><p>To create a surrogate index in the standard paradigm, we need a dataset for which we observe the long-term outcome. The dataset can either be an observational dataset or one composed of prior experiments for which long-run outcomes are observable.</p><p>The exact model used for a surrogate index depends on our beliefs about the conditional expectation of the long-term outcome given the surrogates and pretreatment features. That is, we need to estimate:</p><p><em>E(LTV | surrogates, pretreatment features)</em></p><p>Suppose we believe the conditional expectation is linear in the surrogates. Then we could use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares">ordinary least squares</a> (OLS) model, i.e., a weighted combination of surrogates:</p><p><em>LTV = b_1 x month 1 user revenue + b_2 x month 1 user order count</em>.</p><p>If we instead believe the expectation is likely nonlinear, we can use a more flexible model (e.g., <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">XGBoost</a>) that predicts LTV based on many surrogates and pretreatment features:</p><p><em>LTV = f(surrogates, pretreatment features).</em></p><p>There are two key statistical assumptions to keep in mind when constructing a surrogate index:</p><ol><li>Surrogacy — the set of surrogates (i.e., short-run outcomes) should cover all causal paths between treatment and the long-run outcome.</li><li>Comparability — the mapping (i.e., the conditional expectation) between surrogates and the long-run outcome must be the same in the training data and the future experimental data the surrogate index will be applied to.</li></ol><p>Surrogacy fails in the earlier example where the new incentive impacted order frequency and only one-month revenue was used as a surrogate. Surrogacy is the motivation for the index approach.</p><p>Comparability fails when the regime changes. For example, a surrogate index trained on data from a period in which no incentives existed would not likely provide valid predictions for treatment effects during a period with abundant incentives. Comparability motivates careful choice of the training data to mimic the environment in which the index will ultimately be applied.</p><p>The use of surrogate indices at a tech company is not novel — e.g., see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11922">here</a>. However, we faced a unique challenge in that we wanted to compute long-run treatment effects <em>over a period in which we didn’t actually have comparable data</em>. To address this, we developed a parametric projection approach that we can validate over the period for which we do have comparable data and therefore build confidence in our estimate over periods for which we do not have comparable data.</p><p>So keep reading!</p><h3>Experiment Library</h3><p>Before we get to the modeling, we should talk about the data we use. One’s choice of data to train surrogate indices on is crucial for ensuring that the comparability assumption is (approximately) valid.</p><p>In conjunction with our Data Science team, we built an experiment library that stores data on prior incentive experiments (not just membership incentives) in a unified and centralized manner. Previously, this knowledge and data was distributed across multiple teams.</p><p>We leverage the experiment library in two ways. First, rather than training our surrogate index on purely <em>observational </em>data (e.g., users sampled at completely random points in time), we train it on the records in past experiments<em> </em>to maximize comparability to our future usage for incentive program measurement.</p><h3>Parameterizing NPV and Model Training</h3><p>At Instacart, we are often interested in optimizing for multi-year net present value (NPV), which is the cumulative variable contribution profit (VCP) discounted back to the present over some investment horizon.</p><p>We have only a small set of users for which we have observed multiple years of VCP. If we restrict ourselves to <em>experiments </em>with fully observable post-treatment data, our available sample is restricted even further. <em>This prevents us from training our surrogate model directly on the long-run NPV.</em></p><p>However, we feel confident in our sample of users with at least 1 year of observable VCP. To take advantage of this data, we parametrize a <em>VCP trajectory model </em>and train it on 12–18 months of observable post-treatment data in our experiment library.</p><p>With the VCP trajectory model, rather than predicting a single value for NPV, we predict the <em>full</em> <em>sequence </em>of VCP for each post-intervention month.</p><p>A key challenge is enabling our VCP trajectory model to fit non-monotonic trajectories. For example (as shown below via fabricated figures), an IC+ membership incentive may lose VCP over time due to discounted fees, and then generate VCP in the long-run from improved retention and membership renewal dues.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*8craWYXpHxt4OYQh" /></figure><p>To capture the non-monotonic trajectory, we flexibly estimate the <em>levels </em>for each of the initial few periods post-treatment and then use a simpler parameterized model to estimate a single long-running post-treatment <em>trend </em>for each user.</p><p>For estimating levels, we use XGBoost to predict each month’s level as a function of (a) pre-treatment features, (b) surrogates, and (c) a feature containing the specific post-treatment month of the prediction. By including the time feature, we allow the model to flexibly learn non-parametric relationships between the outcome and each time period.</p><p>For estimation of the trends subsequent to the first few periods, we specify a growth model of the outcome based on our institutional knowledge. For example, we could specify a logarithmic growth model:</p><p><em>log(VCP_t) = ɑ * log(VCP_t-1).</em></p><p>Note that this is governed by a single scalar parameter ɑ which may vary across users. We can then invert the growth model and train an XGBoost model to predict the heterogeneous scalar parameter given <em>log(VCP_t) / log(VCP_t-1)</em>, i.e.,</p><p><em>ɑ = log(VCP_t) / log(VCP_t-1).</em></p><p>For prediction, we combine the two models. For the initial few periods, we use the levels as predicted by the <em>levels</em> model. For the subsequent periods, we use the growth model with the predicted heterogeneous growth parameter to extrapolate the trajectory of our predictions.</p><p>Lastly, we do not model VCP directly. Rather, we decompose VCP into its subcomponents and model the trajectory separately for each component as outlined above. Specifically, we decompose VCP into the probability a user is an active orderer in a given month (pMAO) and the expected VCP conditional on being MAO. Thus, VCP can be written as:</p><p><em>VCP = p(MAO) * E(VCP | MAO = 1).</em></p><p>Then we estimate the semiparametric and parametric trend models separately for each subcomponent.</p><p>Our decisions to predict the full trajectory of VCP, include semi-parametric and parametric trend models, and decompose VCP into subcomponents has several advantages.</p><ol><li>It utilizes additional information about the impact of the intervention (i.e., trends, not just levels).</li><li>It provides a parametric model for simulating outcomes for out-of-sample periods for which we do not have useful training data, but for which we have institutional knowledge.</li><li>It facilitates backtesting across a range of experiments with different durations (See <em>Backtesting Section</em> below).</li><li>It facilitates continual evaluation of predictions from live experiments as we observe the true values each month.</li></ol><h3>Backtesting</h3><p>At this point, we have a semi-parametric, longitudinal model of each customer’s profit over time, for which we’ve done the usual out-of-sample validation on vanilla predictive fit (i.e., predicting a given outcome’s <em>level</em>). But how accurately (and precisely) can our model recover the desired long-run <em>treatment effects</em>? This is where backtesting comes in.</p><p>Because we can accurately estimate long-run treatment effects from older experiments in our experiment library, these provide a natural candidate for backtesting the capability of our model to provide accurate imputations of the long-run treatment effects. Thus, our most important testing procedure consists of comparing the average treatment effects (ATEs) on actual long-term outcomes that we can estimate via our experiment library against the average treatment effects on our surrogate index. Testing for equality of the two sets of treatment effects is equivalent to jointly testing the surrogate index assumptions we made above (although we must keep in mind that the test is limited to the treatments and time-horizons that are covered by the experiment library).</p><p><strong>Medium-run vs.</strong> <strong>long-run. </strong>An important caveat to our approach is that long-term outcomes that are many years into the future factor heavily into decisions based on customer LTV, but we can only backtest based on medium-term outcomes. Thus, there’s a theoretical risk that surrogate indices that perform well at medium-run treatment effect imputation are secretly bad at long-run treatment effect imputation.</p><p>This is the main reason that we employ a semi-parametric modeling strategy. Our model produces a generic time-free estimate of several future intermediate outcomes (retention and profit per retained customer), extrapolates those estimates to different horizons based on a few very low-dimensional parameters, and combines retention and profit per retained customer into a final profit outcome. By imposing this parsimonious structure in the model, we believe we are increasing the correlation between medium-term and long-term accuracy. Furthermore, by visually inspecting the trends in the accuracy of the imputed treatment effects over time, we can make reasonable extrapolations of how accurate it will be in the long-term.</p><p><strong>Pre-treatment dimensions. </strong>One of the major applications of our surrogate index is to estimate the efficacy of personalized targeting policies that change the mix of interventions given to different segments of customers. For this kind of application, it’s ideal to have a surrogate index that yields accurate <em>conditional</em> average treatment effect (CATE) imputations, conditional on the type of information that is typically used in targeting applications, and <em>not </em>merely accurate ATE imputations. To test for accurate CATE imputation, we re-run our comparisons between actual and imputed ATEs along a suite of pretreatment customer segments.</p><p><strong>Results. </strong>Overall, we were able to demonstrate significant improvements in overall ATE accuracy, even larger improvements in CATE accuracy for individual segments, and more reassuring <em>trends </em>in ATE accuracy, as a result of replacing simple univariate translation methods with a high-dimensional ML-powered surrogate index.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*QUd6q9xlR2vnemE0" /></figure><p>Overall, our resulting surrogate index exhibited significant improvements over our status-quo frameworks for measuring long-run treatment effects.</p><h3>Deploying and Continual Evaluation</h3><p>With our models trained, we set up a daily batch job to score all users on their full VCP trajectory path. We use these VCP trajectories to construct experimental metrics for ongoing tests as well as for potential use in our underlying incentive targeting ML models.</p><p>Moreover, as we mentioned before, an advantage of predicting the full trajectory is that we can perform continual evaluation of our model’s performance on live experiments or post-launch of an incentive program as outlined in the image below.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Z3KLBpian-PAr7K_" /></figure><h3>Wrapping Up</h3><p>Membership incentive targeting is just one example of how surrogate indices can be applied. More generally, they are well-suited for measuring the long-term treatment effects of any <em>short-run</em> treatment.

        <h2>Data Science Spotlight: Cracking the SQL Interview at Instacart (LLM Edition)</h2>
        </a>
            
            <p><span class="company">tech-at-instacart - Medium</span>: <p>By: Anahita Tafvizi, Michael Curran, Monta Shen</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*u9hfTgNB7fANQlppSyloOA.png" /></figure><p>Data Scientists at Instacart require a unique combination of skills to be successful on the job. They need to have a combination of business acumen, analytical, communication and technical skills. The Data Science interview loop tests the candidate for these skills, beginning with the Technical Screen — including a SQL interview where candidates show that they can translate business questions into code that retrieves the correct data from databases. This set of questions generally provides the candidate with a set of schemas and common business questions where they then leverage SQL to translate data into insights.</p><p>Here’s an example of such a question:</p><p><em>Using these two tables, ascertain:</em></p><ol><li>What are average ratings by day? Include only users with 5+ orders.</li><li>Is there a relationship between order number and average ratings?</li></ol><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/708/1*MkQyYaBxZfogMswl-dLA6g.png" /></figure><p><strong>LLM Cracks the Interview</strong></p><p>Before the rise in popularity of LLMs for coding use cases, Data Scientists would have to write code manually to retrieve data through databases and manipulate the data to achieve the desired insight. Now that LLMs are widely accessible, Data Scientists are able to write and edit code through natural language, saving significant amounts of time and effort.</p><p>A more efficient way to ask and answer the above interview question would be to simply ask LLMs. An example prompt would include the schemas above, the questions and the task.</p><blockquote><em>Here are the schemas:</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>&lt;&lt;INSERT SCHEMAS&gt;&gt;</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Here are the questions:</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>&lt;&lt; INSERT QUESTIONS&gt;&gt;</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Here is the task:</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Write Snowflake SQL to answer the above questions.</em></blockquote><p>Here’s a truncated depiction of what might happen when we use this prompt in <a href="https://www.instacart.com/company/how-its-made/scaling-productivity-with-ava-instacarts-internal-ai-assistant/">Ava</a>, Instacart’s internal AI assistant powered by OpenAI and other models. Ava is able to write all the necessary SQL to answer the interview questions.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*gxzqj82zHtvyVzNu" /></figure><p>Through a quick test of this prompt via a few popular LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o, Snowflake Arctic and Llama 3–70B), each is able to do these tasks correctly.</p><p><strong>Rethinking the SQL Interview at Instacart</strong></p><p>Having candidates write live SQL to test their ability to code is both ineffective and a poor representation of on-the-job workflows. This usually leads to questions needing to be extremely simple in order to fit a time constraint and unfairly penalizes candidates if they do not write SQL daily. Moreover, interviews that can be solved easily through a simple prompt and relevant context are not effective ways to test candidates–especially considering Instacart Data Scientists will be expected to leverage AI in their workflows.</p><p>Given this evolution, we’re making changes to our SQL interview process to orient more around AI-forward workflows that have become best practice on our team. Now, as part of their SQL interview, Instacart Data Science candidates may be asked to:</p><ul><li><strong>Translate an insight into a prompt for a SQL query </strong>— this tests a candidate’s ability to<a href="https://tech.instacart.com/monte-carlo-puppetry-and-laughter-the-unexpected-joys-of-prompt-engineering-4b9272e0c4eb"> prompt engineer</a> and translate a business question into an actionable data pull.</li><li><strong>Explain and debug a sample SQL query</strong> — this tests a candidate’s ability to understand and fix LLM-generated SQL outputs.</li><li><strong>Identify ways to make a sample SQL query more efficient </strong>— this tests a candidate’s deep understanding of SQL, both in writing and processing efficiently.</li></ul><p>This reimagined SQL interview, combined with our other technical and non-technical interviews (e.g. product sense, statistics, cross-functional partnership, analytics), will give the team a better understanding of candidate skills and allow us to continue to up-level the Data Science team at Instacart.</p><p>For more information on the interview process and to see our open Data Science roles, please visit <a href="https://instacart.careers/current-openings/">Instacart’s Careers Page</a>.</p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=52d04bde474c" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://tech.instacart.com/data-science-spotlight-cracking-the-sql-interview-at-instacart-llm-edition-52d04bde474c">Data Science Spotlight: Cracking the SQL Interview at Instacart (LLM Edition)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://tech.instacart.com">tech-at-instacart</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p></p>

What’s less known is that Instacart also equips <a href="https://www.instacart.com/company/retailer-platform/connected-stores">grocers</a> with sophisticated digital tools to streamline their operations. And yes, AI can significantly enhance these tools as well.</p><p>Take Instacart’s <a href="https://www.foodstorm.com/">Order Management System</a> (OMS), FoodStorm, for instance. FoodStorm allows grocers to offer customizable products: think freshly made sandwiches, sliced deli meats, and personalized cakes — not to mention a full Thanksgiving dinner complete with all the trimmings. These items are far more complex than your standard “center aisle” assortment because of their customizable nature; for example, choosing from various sandwich fillings or cake decorations.</p><figure><img alt="Building a sandwich with FoodStorm" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*WMCsxhdr_asceu_K" /></figure><p>So how can AI play a part here? An ongoing bugbear our grocers face is sourcing <em>images</em> for every possible product configuration. High quality food photography is crucial for online shopping, elevating the consumer’s experience. This is where Generative AI comes in — it can produce stellar images of virtually any food product, offering a feasible solution for showcasing diverse food options.</p><p>Some of you might be gasping at the thought of AI-generated images. It’s essential to clarify that nothing can replace the authenticity of professional photographs showing the real product. However, for visualizing various fillings, toppings and sides, Generative AI can be a huge help. Our tests show that AI excels at creating these kinds of images — think perfectly diced onions, finely shredded lettuce, or just the right amount of strawberry jam.</p><figure><img alt="Images created by Google Imagen" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*LXV4HRu5J9Y_aaRkgB6hFw.jpeg" /></figure><p><em>A selection of images created by Google Imagen. Imagen also does a great job of creating images “on a white background”, which is a challenge sometimes for other AI tools.</em></p><p>Integrating AI into FoodStorm began with leveraging Instacart’s in-house Content AI team. We were lucky to have a dedicated text-to-image service, called <em>Pixel, </em>already operational. Pixel provides easy access to a range of different AI models, including Google <em>Imagen</em>, and has controls around acceptable use of prompts to generate images. It was a dream to integrate with and saved us considerable time.</p><p>However, the main challenge was to create the user interface design to allow retailers to create AI images themselves. Our initial design allowed for one-click AI image generation for any sandwich fillings, impressively demonstrated in our early tests and generated much internal excitement:</p><figure><img alt="FoodStorm’s AI Image Generation Spike" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/970/0*26pKbtN6_vC0u9ll" /></figure><p><em>Our initial AI image generation spike was coded directly into FoodStorm OMS.</em></p><p>But the design had flaws. Simply using the filling name as the <em>prompt, </em>like “cheese,” was too vague — what type of cheese, and sliced or grated? These nuances were missing, leading to suboptimal images.</p><p>To address this, we wireframed a new design where users can fine-tune their prompts, specifying details like, “sliced monterey jack cheese on a white background.” Users can also preview multiple image variations to choose the most appropriate result:</p><figure><img alt="Wireframe of the Generate AI Image UI" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*JaFZxylfSW6zLQ-L" /></figure><p>We then landed on a third iteration that also provides a larger preview of the selected image. This allows users to take a close look at the details of the image, as occasionally you’ll get artifacts that may be slightly off. As we all know, AI doesn’t always nail it on the first try.</p><figure><img alt="AI generated images of grated cheese" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/863/0*v4BNkARQqqIt-QqI" /></figure><p><em>Find the perfect grated cheese, checking closely for errors.</em></p><figure><img alt="AI generated raspberries with a random creature" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/719/0*Cs_yau7lJR0JikUF" /></figure><p><em>An example of the AI model getting it wrong — is that an Australian Bilby nibbling those raspberries?! Arguably, sales might go up with an image as cute as this.</em></p><p>Aside from product images, FoodStorm uses Generative AI to create hero images, promotional content, category thumbnails and more. The new <em>Create AI Image</em> dialog box builds on our existing image upload component — so anywhere that users could previously upload an image, they could now instantly create an AI image. This feature alone has enabled us to produce stunning promotional visuals effortlessly.</p><figure><img alt="Assorted sandwich platters" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/795/0*RdI7vAcsCUa1cKYF" /></figure><p><em>Generative AI is not just limited to basic ingredients!</em></p><figure><img alt="An AI generated website header" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*XKtZQ8kyv0tstx5l" /></figure><p><em>A quick and easy promotional banner created using AI.</em></p><p>The integration process also involved compressing and scaling the images post-generation to optimize them for web use, and serving them efficiently through our content delivery network. From a legal standpoint, users must also agree to relevant terms of use before using this feature. Now, AI-generated images can be published across the Instacart Platform, including the Instacart App, Storefront &amp; Storefront Pro and FoodStorm Kiosk for in-store ordering.</p><p>AI represents an exciting new frontier, and it’s essential to balance its use with genuine photography and other creative channels. When used in the right way, and with quality controls in place, AI can be a significant time saver and dynamic creative tool. We’re eager to see how our grocery retailers embrace FoodStorm’s AI capabilities.</p><p><em>If you’re interested in what FoodStorm can do for your grocery prepared foods business, contact us today: </em><a href="https://www.foodstorm.com/book-demo"><em>https://www.foodstorm.com/book-demo</em></a><em>.</em></p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d76a74867fa4" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://tech.instacart.com/enhancing-foodstorm-with-ai-image-generation-d76a74867fa4">Enhancing FoodStorm with AI Image Generation</a> was originally published in <a href="https://tech.instacart.com">tech-at-instacart</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p></p>

If you missed them, be sure to have a look at our previous post <a href="https://tech.instacart.com/the-economics-team-at-instacart-94c48db951e8">introducing the Economics Team at Instacart</a> and our post highlighting how we used <a href="https://tech.instacart.com/optimizing-at-the-edge-using-regression-discontinuity-designs-to-power-decision-making-51e296615046">regression discontinuity designs to optimize authorization buffers</a>.</p><p>In this post, we venture into the realm of paid marketing, an area rich with challenging causal inference problems. Our post presents a framework that we have recently developed at Instacart to optimize the efficiency of our paid marketing budgets via adaptive experimentation. While we explicitly focus on paid marketing in this post, the topic of adaptive experimentation is an exciting one that we are particularly passionate about and we will release future blog posts to dive deeper into several impactful applications.</p><h3>Problem: Efficient Allocation of Marketing Budgets</h3><p>Companies like Instacart deploy vast paid marketing budgets to attract and retain customers. When deciding how much to spend, such companies typically try to maximize an objective function that relates the return generated through a particular marketing campaign to its cost:</p><p><em>Objective := Return — Cost</em></p><p>The problem for marketers boils down to understanding how a given marketing action (e.g., setting a target <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6268632?hl=en">cost per action</a> or CPA) relates to this objective. The plot below presents one such “performance curve”, relating the marketing action to the company’s objective. Once we have identified this curve, it becomes straightforward to identify the action that maximizes the objective.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/0*JwQdUgQhLAzrrHYF" /></figure><p>The plot above provides an example of a performance curve for a hypothetical marketing campaign (i.e., simulated data). While the x-axis indicates the chosen marketing action (e.g., the level of target CPA), the y-axis shows the value of the objective at this point. The curve presents our current best estimate of the relationship between the two.</p><p>Herein lies the problem: Getting a believable estimate of such performance curves is extremely challenging. In reality, the actions taken by the company in the past are anything but random. As a result, all the observational data from past marketing actions is deeply confounded. For example, marketers will often lean into specific events or holidays in anticipation of an increase in customer interest. Similarly, competitors may decide to spend more, which increases the cost-per-click and total spend, but reduces performance in terms of achieved returns. In these cases, the correlations in the observational data would result in getting the sign of the relationship wrong! Evidently, such observational curve estimates are unreliable to guide decision-making.</p><h3>Solution: Adaptive Experimentation</h3><p>So how do we solve this? By using adaptive experimentation!</p><p>At Instacart, we have developed an adaptive experimentation system that intelligently introduces random perturbations into our marketing actions. These random perturbations generate the exogenous variation needed to credibly identify and map out performance curves. Over time, this allows us to gradually move from more exploration (to accurately learn the curves) to exploitation (to maximize our returns).</p><p>Before going into more detail, it’s worth taking a step back to briefly describe what adaptive experimentation is all about. We can think of an adaptive experiment as an intermediate between running a fully randomized experiment and no experiment at all. With a fully randomized experiment, we allocate a set number of observations to each treatment arm, obtaining maximal exploration. However, we also incur inefficiencies because we keep the worse performing arms active. By contrast, with no experiment, we maximally exploit what we believe to be the best arm, but we also incur great risk of being wrong as we do not explore other arms at all. Adaptive experiments strike a balance between exploration and exploitation by randomizing across arms, but with an adaptive bias toward better performing arms.</p><h3>Under the Hood</h3><p>Let’s now get back to the problem of optimizing our marketing spend. At a high level, our adaptive experimentation system consists of two steps that repeat in a continuous loop:</p><ol><li><strong>Step N: Modeling Performance Curves.</strong> At a regular cadence, the system updates its estimates of the performance curves of all the marketing campaigns it controls. These updates incorporate all the latest observations. Importantly, they incorporate the action propensities that were generated by the second step to ensure valid causal inference (more on that below).</li><li><strong>Step N + 1: Choice of the Next Action.</strong> Once the system has updated its estimates of the performance curves, an explore-exploit algorithm determines the appropriate next action for each campaign. This algorithm intelligently trades off the value of further exploration (or more randomization) against the cost of choosing an action that may not be optimal.</li></ol><p>Let’s unpack both steps in more detail.</p><h4>Modeling Performance Curves</h4><p>Our system frequently updates its estimates of performance curves, incorporating the latest data on historical actions and outcomes. The key component of our causal inference strategy is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3Y8heXoDxE">inverse-propensity-weighted (IPW)</a> regression. This is a common causal inference technique which re-weights the dataset to correct for selection bias, in this case stemming from favoring actions that are believed to be optimal. For example, data-points from actions that are less likely to be chosen are given larger weight, because such observations are more informative. We provide more details on this process in the next section.</p><p>We currently estimate curves using a <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~rplevy/pmsl_textbook/chapters/pmsl_4.pdf">Bayesian parametric model</a>, parameterized to enforce several constraints that prevent implausible curve fits and to embed structural knowledge about the outcomes. For example, we know that the performance curve must start from zero when spend is zero. We have found that this approach works quite well in practice, though we are actively exploring alternatives (e.g., <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/cs731/bnp.pdf">Gaussian Process regression</a>, a Bayesian nonparametric model).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Z63B8a-qmX7XuGD5" /></figure><p><em>We use a functional form based on the Beta distribution’s pdf, shown here. With two parameters, it is quite flexible and can represent a wide variety of hump-shaped curves, including asymmetric ones.</em></p><h4>Choice of the Next Action</h4><p>To strike a balance between exploration and exploitation, our model does not simply output the best fitting curve — it produces a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_probability">Bayesian posterior distribution</a> over parameter vectors representing different possible curves. This distribution reflects the probability of each parameter vector being the true representation of the performance curve given the observed historical data.</p><p>With this posterior distribution over performance curves in hand, we then leverage the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_sampling">Thompson Sampling</a> algorithm to make intelligent tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation. If the observed data is noisy and we are less certain about our estimate of the true performance curve, the algorithm will nudge us to do more exploration. Gradually, as the model builds more confidence through more and better data, it shifts toward more exploitation. This entire explore-exploit process is done in a fully automated way. In practice, the Thompson Sampling algorithm’s implementation is astonishingly simple:</p><ol><li>Draw a parameter vector from the model’s posterior distribution.</li><li>Assume that these parameters specify the true curve and take the optimal action for that curve.</li></ol><h4>System in Action</h4><p>The graph below provides an illustration of the system running on two rounds of simulated data. In the first round, the performance curve is fitted to all the available data. Next, an action is chosen based on the Thomson sampling algorithms. As new data arrives in round 2, the system repeats this process, first updating its model of the performance curve and then choosing a new action via Thompson Sampling.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/0*ibZ0VzrcInEtFuqn" /></figure><p><em>Illustration of system behavior using simulated data.</em></p><h3>Wrapping Up</h3><p>Adaptive experimentation systems are proving exceedingly useful at Instacart. They strike an appealing balance between competing objectives and are based on solid and intuitive theoretical foundations. They do, however, also come with additional technical challenges that require a rigorous engineering solution. We have found that the cost associated with the latter is more than worth it. In controlled A/B tests of the system described above, for example, we have seen large improvements in marketing efficiency relative to our existing processes.</p><p>If you would generally like to learn more about our work, check out the <a href="https://tech.instacart.com/the-economics-team-at-instacart-94c48db951e8">intro to our team</a> and stay tuned for more posts about our work.

We may do this for power analysis/sample size calculations prior to running an experiment using historical data, or after an experiment for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. The different applications have a common framework, using the sample variance of certain residuals. The framework is compatible with modular software, can be plugged into standard tools, doesn’t require computing covariance matrices, and is numerically stable. Using this approach we estimate that covariate adjustment gives a median 66% variance reduction for a key metric, reducing experiment run time by 66%. Readers who prefer precise notation can find a version of this article on </em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06834"><em>arXiv</em></a><em>.</em><a href="https://tech.instacart.com/feed#96d4">¹</a></p><h4>Power Analysis — Where Standard Tools Fall Short</h4><p>When running A/B tests (randomized controlled trials), time is money. The faster we can run experiments, the faster we can ship promising treatments. We might put a lot of effort into variance-reduction techniques to obtain more accurate answers, but if power analysis/sample size planning tools don’t reflect that then the experiments we design will run longer than necessary. Most off-the-shelf power analysis tools handle the simple case where analysis uses 𝑡-tests for independent observations, but not clustered data, ratio metrics, or variance-reduction methods. In this article we present a framework for conducting power analysis for A/B tests that can support any combination of the following applications:</p><p><strong><em>Clustered Data:</em></strong><em> If we are interested in testing a feature that improves the customer experience, then the most intuitive unit of randomization for an A/B test is the customer. However, customers may place multiple orders. If the metric of interest is at the level of the order (e.g. mean order size) then we need to take this clustering into account when calculating standard errors.</em></p><p><strong><em>Ratio Metrics:</em></strong><em> Some metrics are a ratio between two random quantities, e.g. ‘Revenue Share from Electronics’ = (revenue from electronics)/(total revenue). Standard errors depend on the variances of the numerator, denominator, and their correlation.</em></p><p><strong><em>Covariate Adjustment:</em></strong><em> While random assignment makes experiment arms balanced on average, random imbalances do occur. We can reduce the variance of estimates by correcting for this covariate imbalance using regression. Standard errors should reflect this improvement.</em></p><p>These applications reduce to four basic cases, combinations of simple means or ratio metrics (including clustered data), with or without covariate adjustment. In all cases we obtain standard errors using the sample standard deviations of certain residuals. We begin with a review of power analysis for unadjusted means in the next section, and consider the other cases in the sections on <a href="https://tech.instacart.com/feed#733b">Ratio Metrics and Clustered Data</a>, <a href="https://tech.instacart.com/feed#61a7">Covariate Adjustment</a>, and <a href="https://tech.instacart.com/feed#6bc9">Covariate Adjustment for Ratio Metrics</a>. The penultimate section (<a href="https://tech.instacart.com/feed#5fdc">Applications</a>) includes a summary of the standard errors and residuals in <a href="https://tech.instacart.com/feed#a1a7">Table 1</a>, as well as a real-world example and a meta-analysis from Instacart.</p><h4>Conventional Power Analysis: A Refresher</h4><p>Power analysis (or sample size planning) involves relationships between four parameters of interest:</p><ol><li>sample size (<em>n</em>) representing the number of units selected for experimental assignment,</li><li>false positive rate (type I error rate) α,</li><li>power (1−β, where β is the type II error rate), the probability of detecting differences of a given magnitude, and</li><li>minimum detectable effect (MDE) — the change in the response variable that is detectable with the given power.</li></ol><p>For simplicity we focus on two-arm experiments (“control” and “treatment” arms, denoted using C and T) and focus on power and sample size estimates for a single metric. Let’s define the following terms:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/643/1*e5P1LTQbyl6coJxG0QoF8g.png" /></figure><p>We will focus on one- sided tests because the vast majority of experiments at Instacart are run for the purpose of testing whether a treatment causes a metric to improve. We assume that sample sizes are large enough that both estimates and their corresponding t-statistics are approximately normally distributed.</p><p>The four parameters are related by the equation:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/343/1*OqPbjVeYN-0shw0P7MI0fQ.png" /></figure><p>where zα and zβ are the Normal quantiles corresponding to the type I and II error rates respectively, and SE ∆ depends on <em>n</em>.</p><h4>Power Analysis for a Difference of Means</h4><p>For the simple case of a difference in means assuming equal variances, no clustering, and equal sample sizes</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/329/1*DVG677FbdPrZLy-_rq5mkg.png" /></figure><p>where sʸ is the standard deviation of the response variable. Then given the standard deviation sʸ and any three of MDE, <em>n</em>, α, or β we can calculate the fourth. That factor of 2 arises in a two-armed experiment. Suppose that there are nᶜ and <em>n</em>ᵗ observations in the ‘control’ and ‘treatment’ arms, with sample standard deviations <em>S </em>ᶜ<em> </em>and<em> S </em>ᵗ , then</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/333/1*4crQuek7p9C-fssQypbtUQ.png" /></figure><p>But when planning an experiment we don’t have those sample standard deviations or the actual sample sizes; instead we typically estimate both sample standard deviations using a single value sʸ estimated from historical data, and specify what fraction of observations ψ will be allocated to the treatment group; then the above equation reduces to</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/704/1*EVUb1vYc-8tZ3PuWqS7oXQ.png" /></figure><p>In the special case that ψ = 50%, then</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/244/1*rStlw_kX5h1HCZaIoDHedQ.png" /></figure><p>More generally, Figure 1 shows how standard errors depend on ψ. The<br />minimum scaling factor is 2 at 50%, and is slightly larger for values near 50%, but increases dramatically when the fraction approaches 0 or 1.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/895/1*YjUC4wRxfgm1hc-rO41kDg.png" /><figcaption><strong>Figure 1: </strong>Standard error multiplier √(1/(1 − ψ) + 1/ψ). The standard error for the<br />difference of means when one receives fraction ψ of the total sample size n is this factor<br />times s/√n.</figcaption></figure><p>Also note that p-values may be inaccurate if metrics are skewed and the split is not 50–50. The old “<em>n </em>≥ 30” rule for the Central Limit Theorem is badly wrong for skewed data. p-values from a one-sample t test are not reasonably accurate until <em>n</em> &gt; 5,000 for an exponential population<a href="https://tech.instacart.com/feed#96d4">²</a> or <em>n</em> ≥ 125,000 for some important skewed metrics at Instacart. Two-sample tests with a 50–50 split are better because the skewness cancels out for the estimated values of Ȳ ᵗ − Ȳ ᶜ.</p><p>To recap, for an experiment with a 50–50 split</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/329/1*DVG677FbdPrZLy-_rq5mkg.png" /></figure><p>the sample size necessary to achieve a specified MDE is</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/303/1*pPRuDRFGA422R6ENMt_sLA.png" /></figure><p>For splits other than 50–50, substitute √(1 / (1−ψ) + 1 / ψ) for 2, but take care to check that skewness does not invalidate normal approximations.</p><h4>Generalizing Beyond Difference of Means</h4><p>It turns out that the above equations almost work for clustered data, ratio metrics, and covariate adjustment applications — we just need to replace the value sʸ with other quantities that are based on residual standard deviations. Our broad strategy for deriving these values is shown in Figure 2.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Kb_2f4BYHorv9mAz0Fr7xw.png" /><figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Strategy for estimating standard errors given multiple observations per unit of experimental assignment, covariate adjustment, and their combination.</figcaption></figure><p>To correctly estimate standard errors we need to account for two factors. First, when data are clustered there is intra-cluster correlation (the top portion of the Venn diagram); ignoring this typically results in standard errors that are too small, causing inflated false positive rates and too-short confidence intervals. Second, controlling for random imbalances in covariates between arms reduces the variability of estimates; ignoring this results in too-large standard errors. Finally, these factors may occur together. In subsequent sections we describe how to estimate standard errors in these cases, using ratio estimates and residual standard deviations.</p><h4>Ratio Metrics and Clustered Data</h4><p>In this section we discuss how ratio metrics arise, either due to clustering or natural ratio metrics, and derive standard errors. Our first challenge is clustered data. For example, consider estimating average order size (in dollars). We call this GMV per order (Gross Merchandise Value). Calculating the metric is straightforward, as the total value of items ordered divided by the number of orders. Calculating the standard error is not. We must account for correlations within clusters (for example, orders created by the same customer will tend to be of similar sizes).</p><p>We begin by aggregating the data by cluster to obtain two values for each customer: Y<em>ⁱ</em> = total value of items ordered by customer<em> i</em>, and n<em>ⁱ</em> = number of orders by customer <em>i</em>. Then the metric is a ratio of ∑ Y<em>ⁱ</em> / ∑ n<em>ⁱ </em>, or equivalently the ratio of two sample means Y-bar / n-bar. This simplifies the problem in one way — we now have independent observations — but complicates it in others. Instead of a sample mean, we have a ratio of two sample means, and the numerator and denominator are dependent.</p><p>Other metrics represent naturally occurring ratios, even without clustering. For example, some retailers have their own in-store workers pick some orders, then Instacart shoppers deliver them to customers. The fraction of GMV picked by Instacart shoppers is a ratio: GMV picked by Instacart shoppers / total GMV. Clustering may also occur with such natural ratio metrics, e.g. clustering from the order level to shopper or store level.</p><p>We use the following notation to handle ratio metrics, with or without clus- tering. Y corresponds to the metric of interest, or numerator of a ratio. Where there is clustering, we let</p><ul><li>Y<em>ij </em>= Cluster i, Observation j (e.g. customer <em>i</em>, order <em>j</em>)</li><li>Yi = Σ<em>j</em> Y<em>ij</em> = Sum for Cluster <em>i</em></li></ul><p>W corresponds to the denominator, to a cluster size or count,</p><ul><li>W<em>i</em> = Σ<em>j</em> W<em>ij</em> or<em> </em>n<em>i</em></li></ul><p>The individual or cluster ratio is</p><ul><li>V<em>i</em> = Cluster-level average (or ratio): Y<em>i</em> / W<em>i</em></li></ul><p>We estimate the metric or ratio of interest as:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/569/1*IrC_yuwd4_XBrvnP2LtfDw.png" /></figure><p>While it might be natural to think of these metrics as weighted averages, i.e. ∑ Wᵢ Yᵢ / ∑ Wᵢ, doing so makes calculating standard errors tricky (see the appendix in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06834">arXiv</a> version). Instead we estimate standard errors for ratio metrics using the delta method.</p><h4>Standard Errors Using the Delta Method and Residuals</h4><p>We turn now to calculating standard errors for ratio metrics, whether due to clustering or not. We use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_method">delta method</a>. We find a linear approximation to the ratio, based on a first-order bivariate Taylor series of the function <em>f</em>(W̅, Y̅) = Y̅ / W̅ about (μ<em>w</em>, μ<em>y</em>),</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/691/1*HY9heV_sBpdIp7xw_fbTLw.png" /></figure><p>where μʸ and μᵂ are the population means for the response variable per cluster and number of observations per cluster respectively. The estimate Θ, is approximately true value of the ratio plus the mean residual divided by the true mean denominator. We visualize this in Figure 3.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/312/1*W5UFiiilb6jMxlYwSRPkHg.png" /><figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> The true slope θ is the slope of a line through the origin and the true<br />mean (μW , μY ) (shown in red). The estimated slope θ-hat is the slope of the line through<br />the origin and the sample mean ( W̅, Y̅ ) (line not shown). Even though Y̅ &lt; μY , the<br />estimated slope θ is greater than the true slope θ because the average residual is greater<br />than zero. Let R̅ = Y̅ − θW̅ be the average residual relative to the true line. The<br />difference θ-hat minus θ between the true and estimated slopes is exactly equal to R̅ / W̅, and<br />is approximately equal to R̅ / μW . For large samples the error in the approximation is<br />small, because the difference between W̅ and μW is small, and R̅ is small.</figcaption></figure><p>Then the variance approximation is</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/675/1*vNXlqs4BSKlkNt6hcM43og.png" /></figure><p>A common next step would be to expand Var(Y − θW ) using variances<br />and covariances. We prefer not to do this. Thinking of the variance in terms<br />of the variance of residuals is easier to understand, particularly as we con-<br />sider covariate adjustment below. Furthermore, that expansion can result in numerically-unstable estimates, including negative variances.<br />In practice, when we use the above equation, we substitute estimates for unknown quantities:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/526/1*IxbmAnWKAMPTmyktB_mWFg.png" /></figure><p>where</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/239/1*bH8XAE8kke4xmpk_hw_XKg.png" /></figure><p>is the sample variance of the empirical residuals:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/180/1*ZqxinA997TNRtRGkOQHPEA.png" /></figure><p>Finally, the standard error is</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/206/1*DpGWH9y7EUeOMTK7bxA9nw.png" /></figure><h4>Covariate Adjustment</h4><p>In a randomized controlled trial the assignment of subjects to arms is fair on average, but in any trial there may be imbalances. For example, if the outcome of interest is customer spend, one arm might have more customers with high spend in the month before the experiment starts. We can improve estimates of the experimental effect by correcting for such imbalances. This is covariate adjustment (or CUPED, ANCOVA, controls, control variates, regression adjustment, etc.).</p><p>Figure 4 shows how this works for the case of one covariate (one predictor),<br />using linear regression. The mean Y is clearly larger for the treatment group than for the control group. However, that is not solely due to the treatment; the treatment group also has larger X values than the control group, which inflates Y̅ among the treatment group, and depresses Y̅ within the control group. We correct for the imbalance using the predictions at the common mean x̅.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/701/1*wdMbtgPifOEheQOT0kwnWQ.png" /><figcaption><strong>Figure 4: </strong>Covariate adjustment corrects for imbalances in predictors between control<br />and treatment groups. The adjusted estimates μC and μT estimate the group means<br />if both groups had the same mean for x values. Here the imbalance is exaggerated<br />(differences in x’s this large are extremely unlikely in a randomized controlled trial).</figcaption></figure><p>For multiple regression with 𝑝 predictors we fit separate regression models to the control and treatment data, both of the form</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/244/1*8ujNMRCwOk2AoUc88BATGQ.png" /></figure><p>Then revised estimates for each arm are:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/303/1*uL5pM3WtTil4Nhsg6nPTfw.png" /></figure><p>where x̅ⱼis the common mean of the <em>j</em>th predictor.</p><p>Fitting separate models is equivalent to fitting a single model that includes<br />interactions of the treatment variable with all predictors. We could fit a single model that excludes some interactions; this corresponds to fitting separate models but with the constraint that</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/138/1*w5PbBiYZW8yIXzFmIRyq8g.png" /></figure><p>for some values of <em>j</em> (and using the same prediction formulas).</p><p>These estimates are a special case of the general rule:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/906/1*pwC8-gLftli6mwFXqGuw3w.png" /></figure><p>These averages are over all observations, regardless of which arm <em>i</em> was assigned to; in other words, we estimate what the mean responses would be, if both arms had the same distribution of <em>x</em> values.</p><h4>Standard Errors using Residuals</h4><p>To calculate the standard errors for covariate adjusted estimates we begin with the residuals. For each group (C and T separately), the residual standard deviation is</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/398/1*W1DvKP4-d7Yb0BVRM7lDdg.png" /></figure><p>Then the standard error is</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/150/1*uViJAiR_7VJTtDJTrnVS3Q.png" /></figure><p>We are intentionally excluding a term from this standard error. Consider the control arm, and let σ²<em>c</em> be the variance of residuals relative to the true regression line/plane. The prediction at <em>x̅c</em> is Y̅<em>c</em>, which has variance σ²<em>c</em>/<em>n</em>, which we estimate using the standard deviation of the residuals from the control arm divided by the number of units of assignment (s²<em>ᵣc / n</em>). The missing term is the extra variance for predictions at other points, in particular at <em>x̅</em>. But in randomized trials with large samples, <em>x̅ </em>is typically close to the group mean <em>x̅c</em>, and the additional variance is negligible.</p><p>Similarly, we are not using heteroskedasticity-consistent (HC) calculations for standard errors or covariance matrices. HC methods would have a negligible impact on variances for predictions at or near <em>x̅</em>.</p><p>In fact, our approach avoids the need to ever estimate covariance matrices for the coefficients. This makes it practical to use covariates with a large number of levels, e.g. customers, using fitting methods that do not produce covariance matrices.</p><h4>Covariate Adjustment for Ratio Metrics</h4><p>To apply covariate adjustment to ratio metrics, we use regression adjustments independently for the numerator Y and denominator W, obtaining</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/787/1*NhOilTIpE3UuMGvqXjtVIg.png" /></figure><p>The covariate-adjusted ratio estimates are</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/215/1*TYR6Imj7t2E-70XKxeskQA.png" /></figure><p>We use the delta method to obtain linear approximations for these estimates. Recall that standard errors for ratio metrics and covariate-adjusted non-ratio metrics both involve residuals; the standard errors here involve “double residuals” that combine elements of both residuals.

We began with a review of conventional power analysis methods for unadjusted differences of means, then described extensions for (1) clustered data using ratios of means, (2) ratios of means using the delta method, and (3) covariate adjustment for both means and ratios of means using regression. The standard errors of estimates ultimately depend on the sample standard deviations sᵣ of certain residuals, plus division by the estimated denominator mean (w̅ or μ̂ ʷ) for ratio estimates. This is summarized in Table 1 (below).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g9c8yX0OZefFhOMAicONCQ.png" /><figcaption><strong>Table 1:</strong> Standard errors for means and ratios of means, with and without covariate adjustment.

Instacart has store planogram data for some retailers — detailed descriptions of the exact location of a given product including the aisle number, shelf number, etc. Providing shoppers with this data could speed up their work and increase the proportion of items they find. This should not only make shoppers’ picking experience easier, but it should have the added benefit of letting shoppers work through their orders more quickly, increasing the average value of delivered orders as measured by GTV-per-order.</p><p>To test this, consider an A/B test randomized at the shopper level, with α = 0.05 and a sample size of 10 million orders (or approximately half a million shoppers). We estimate the variance of the average delivery value from historical data and specify an MDE of $0.05 per order. Using standard t-tests would give a severely under-powered experiment, with power of 15% (see Figure 5).</p><p>We can do better using covariate adjustment. The dollar value of the delivered order Y is highly correlated with the dollar value of the order the customer placed (see models 3 and 4 in Table 2). The number of items in the order W is highly correlated with the sum of estimated probabilities of being in stock (models 2 and 4). Using either of these predictors alone has minimal value for covariate adjustment for the ratio of interest, but using them together gives an R² of 0.927 and improves power to over 92%.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/774/1*KeTO4avzv8z1b5vPvbjfng.png" /><figcaption><strong>Figure 5: </strong>Thoughtful application of covariate adjustment can lead to significant improvement in statistical power.</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xAdbq2sst05kXZ2XWr6pAQ.png" /><figcaption><strong>Table 2:</strong> Results from regressing shopper-level aggregates of GMV and the number of orders-per-shopper on “Item Availability’ (sum of the mean item availability score as estimated by a ML model), and “GMV Amt.” (sum of the tentative chargeable amount). GMV Amt. is highly correlated with Y, and Availability with W. NOTE: The coefficient estimates are rescaled to avoid disclosing sensitive data. Results are based on 10,000,000 orders and 563, 492 shoppers. All t-statistics for coefficients are 8.5 or larger.</figcaption></figure><p>We see how covariate adjustment can increase statistical power, but what about our original mandate — to ship promising treatments as quickly as possible? To explore the impact of covariate adjustment on experiment run times, we conducted a meta-analysis of 3,563 A/B tests comprised of 4,642 individual experiment arms. The response variable for these experiments is Gross Transaction Value (GTV) per customer (this is different from GMV-per-order in Table 2). Instacart adjusts for the following covariates: customer GTV measured during the 60-day pre-assignment period, the customer’s lifetime value (LTV) as estimated from a machine learning model, and the number of days elapsed since experimental assignment.</p><p>Holding statistical power, alpha, and the MDE constant across the covariate adjusted versus non-covariate adjusted versions of these hypothesis tests, we see that the median experiment run time for unadjusted tests is approximately 39 days. In contrast, the median run time using covariate adjustment is 13 days. As a thought exercise, if we were to apply the 26 days of run time saved to all 3,563 experiments, then the total time savings would amount to 253 <em>years</em>. In a world where time, is in fact, money, then the value proposition of covariate adjustment is evident.</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>Using regression in the context of a randomized controlled trial provides a straightforward way to perform covariate adjustment. We must take care not to include covariates that are affected by the treatment, which would bias the results. Nevertheless, covariate adjustment is a powerful tool in our toolkit whenever statistical power is at a premium.</p><p>Unfortunately, most off-the-shelf power analysis tools do not support covariate adjustment. These same tools often fail when presented with clustered data and/or ratio metrics. The approach described above provides a way to conduct power analysis in these cases, without the need for complex simulations.</p><p><em>We would like to thank Mack Sweeney and Michael Curran for their helpful comments and feedback.</em></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> There are places where we use superscripts as this version is limited by the formatting capabilities of Medium.

In a series of follow-up posts, we will take a closer look at how we deploy econometric and machine learning tools to tackle specific business problems.</p><p>In the first post of this series, we will focus on regression discontinuity designs, a powerful econometric technique that can be used to learn causal effects from observational data. We also provide a simple framework for how these estimates can be used to make business-relevant trade-off decisions. We then take this framework to one of the problems we recently worked on and show how we have used it to revise authorization buffers.</p><h3>Framework: Regression Discontinuity Designs &amp; Trade-Off Optimization</h3><h3>Regression Discontinuity Designs</h3><p>At Instacart, we frequently rely on a classic quasi-experimental method to answer business questions: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_discontinuity_design">regression discontinuity designs</a>. In a regression discontinuity design, we rely on natural break points in a system to causally estimate an effect of interest.</p><p>To gain intuition for the concept, consider an ecommerce site that offers customers different service options based on their time of arrival on the site. For example, imagine the site decided to offer every customer arriving before noon a 2-day delivery window, whereas every customer who arrives right after noon is offered a 3-day window. A customer’s arrival time on the site is of course not random, so we cannot quite learn the causal effect of the change in the delivery window on all customers.</p><p>However, there is an interesting quasi-experiment hidden in this data. Arguably, what is random is whether a customer arrives just before or after noon. Imagine now that we plotted a customer’s likelihood of checking out against the time of arrival relative to the noon cutoff and saw something like the following, where the x-axis shows the time of arrival relative to noon and the y-axis shows the average checkout propensity:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*GOAo6LJYre95Ryaj" /></figure><p>Right around noon, we see a sizable drop in checkout propensity. At this time, however, the only thing that arguably changes is that we stop showing customers the faster delivery options.</p><p>This drop thus presents us with a <em>local </em>average treatment effect (LATE) for the impact of the expanded delivery window. This effect is local only since it’s only valid for the customers just to the left and to the right of the cutoff. Or, put differently, it presents an estimate of the treatment effect among the specific set of population affected by the threshold. LATEs are valuable pieces of information that can point us in the correct direction, but they can not provide the average treatment effect (ATE) across the entire user population from a change in policy.</p><h3>Trading Off Business Objectives</h3><p>Regression discontinuity frameworks provide a powerful tool to examine various tradeoffs between metrics around the threshold. Imagine, for instance, the ecommerce site from the example above wanted to evaluate whether it should adjust the delivery threshold to later or earlier in the day. In such a trade-off, decisions would likely be based on a comparison of the incremental value of moving the thresholds and the associated cost. Specifically, moving the threshold to later in the day may generate a number of incremental orders but also put a strain on delivery systems as more orders have to be fulfilled in less time.</p><p>Here is what the site could do to evaluate such a trade-off. Let’s say the site only cares about the number of checkouts and the cost of fulfillment per order. It’s common practice to have a guardrail informed by the long-term value of an incremental order to make such tradeoff decisions. This generates a decision framework that takes the form of:</p><p><em>Incremental orders — guardrail * (incremental fulfillment cost) &gt; 0.</em></p><p>Given this framework, the site can simply plug-in the LATE estimates for orders and fulfillment cost respectively to determine whether to expand or contract eligibility for the shorter delivery window.</p><p>Of course, the site would have to ensure that the assumptions underlying this estimation remain valid in the process. To further finetune the threshold, the platform could run an A/B test (or better yet a Multi-Armed Bandit — more on that in a future post!) to evaluate a series of potential thresholds, repeating the above exercise for each of them and charting out the entire trade-off curve.</p><p>Now let’s turn to an example of how we used this line of thinking to optimize Instacart’s Authorization Buffers.</p><h3>Application: Authorization Buffer Optimization</h3><h3>Discontinuous Authorization Buffers at Instacart</h3><p>When customers shop on Instacart, we face a challenge: How large of a hold should we put on a customer’s credit card? When a customer clicks “Place Order,” we know the initial cost of the items in the customer’s cart as well as the associated fees, taxes, and tips. However, customers can still make changes or add items after the order has been placed. Shopper-initiated replacements for missing items can also change the final charge amounts.</p><p>To enable such post-checkout alterations, we place a so-called authorization hold based on the initial cart total plus an additional “buffer” amount. The scheme we use to determine such buffers needs to trade off competing effects: While higher authorization holds evidently reduce the risk of potential unpaid amounts, they also create a confusing customer experience, even if customers are only charged the actual amount of their final order upon the order’s completion.</p><p>How can we determine the optimal authorization buffer to add? Here’s where a natural experiment in Instacart’s buffer policy comes in.</p><p>To illustrate, we will turn to a hypothetical version of the authorization buffer scheme that resembles the one that was deployed at Instacart at some point in the past. In this scheme, buffers were allocated as follows:</p><ol><li>First, add a buffer of 10% to the order total, and</li><li>Second, round the resulting total up to the next $5.</li></ol><p>The second step was added to avoid odd-looking authorizations to the customer. Notice how the second step in the scheme creates a discontinuous effect. Every time step 1 results in an amount that just exceeds a multiple of five, the total authorization amount jumps by $5! As a result, two orders can generate a $5 difference in the authorization hold even if their actual order amounts are only a single cent apart.</p><p>This discontinuous jump gives us everything we need to estimate a local average treatment effect of the higher buffer amount on the business metrics we care about. Of course, the crucial assumption for a causal interpretation is that users just below the $5 multiple and users just above are the same on average. For example, users who place $100 orders should not be doing so because they know that a $100.01 order would trigger a $5 larger authorization buffer. In our setting, we believe this is a safe assumption.</p><h3>Local Average Treatment Effect Estimation</h3><p>When applying this method to our data, we see something like the following graph (which is for illustrative purposes only). On the x-axis, the graph shows the difference in cents between the customer’s order total and the threshold. The y-axis shows the rate of card declines. At the discontinuity, where the rounding suddenly jumps up to the next $5, we see the users on the right having significantly higher card decline rates than users on the left.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*DoYwlCOUMeA0swHR" /></figure><p>*The plot is for illustrative purposes and does not reflect actual treatment effects or levels in the data.</p><p>We can of course repeat this analysis with other outcomes we may care about, such as unpaid amounts or re-authorization rates. Combining these estimates with a tradeoff framework helps inform us on whether we should be more or less aggressive in our authorization buffers.</p><h3>Authorization Buffers: Navigating the Payment Predicament</h3><p>Following the initial analysis, we developed a revised policy based on the estimated effects. To validate our proposed policy and the ATE, however, we still needed to run an A/B experiment. As part of a series of experiments intended to improve the payment experience for our customers, we ran an experiment where we significantly reduced the amount of upward rounding in the initial authorization buffer. The results validated the insights from our regression discontinuity analysis and generated a significant increase in order volume on Instacart through a reduction in the number of card declines!</p><p>By reducing frictions associated with the initial authorization buffer amounts, we were able to generate a win-win for both customers and Instacart, <em>on average</em>. However, within the average treatment effects may lie important heterogeneity. More broadly, our series of experiments pointed to the realization that adjusting the <em>initial </em>authorization buffer is just the start.</p><p>For some users, the initial authorization is a burdensome friction that needs to be reduced. However, reducing the <em>initial</em> authorization amount has the undesired consequence of <em>increasing </em>the likelihood that a <em>second</em> authorization is needed. For many customers, the subsequent authorization attempts may be a confusing and ultimately poor order experience. Our experiments in this domain are building towards the vision of an authorization and payment platform that can tailor the initial and subsequent authorization rulesets based on current order context and past customer interactions. Our rounding experiment was a stepping stone in this direction.</p><h3>Wrapping Up</h3><p>Applying regression discontinuity to rounding in authorization buffers is just one example of how causal inference can improve customer experiences and generate significant business impact. Discontinuous thresholds naturally appear throughout consumer-facing products beyond payment systems and provide an opportunity to estimate (local) treatment effects without having to first run A/B tests. Other areas where regression discontinuity could be applied include relevance thresholds in search or ads, targeting thresholds for incentives, or product availability thresholds. If there is a threshold that generates a discontinuous product experience, regression discontinuity can be applied!</p><p>If you would like to learn more about our work, check out the <a href="https://tech.instacart.com/the-economics-team-at-instacart-94c48db951e8">intro to our team</a> or our upcoming posts on projects we’ve worked on.

        <h2>Let AI Entertain You: Increasing User Engagement with Generative AI and Rejection Sampling</h2>
        </a>
            
            <p><span class="company">Nextdoor Engineering - Medium</span>: <p>Generative AI (Gen AI) has demonstrated proficiency in content generation but does not consistently guarantee user engagement, mainly for two reasons. First, Gen AI generates content without considering user engagement feedback. While the content may be informative and well-written, it does not always translate to increased user engagement such as clicks. Second, Gen AI-produced content often remains generic and may not always provide the specific information that users seek.</p><p>Nextdoor is the neighborhood network where neighbors, businesses, and public agencies connect with each other. Nextdoor is building innovative solutions to enhance the user engagement with AI-Generated Content (AIGC). This post outlines our approach to improving user engagement through user feedback, specifically focusing on Notification email subject lines. Our solutions employ Rejection sampling [1], a technique used in reinforcement learning, to boost the engagement metrics. We believe our work presents a general framework to drive user engagement with AIGC, particularly when off-the-shelf Generative AI falls short in producing engaging content. To the best of our knowledge, this marks an early milestone in the industry’s successful use of AIGC to enhance user engagement.</p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>At Nextdoor, one of the ways to drive user growth and engagement on platform is through emails. One of the emails we have is called New and Trending <a href="https://engblog.nextdoor.com/nextdoor-notifications-how-we-use-ml-to-keep-neighbors-informed-57d8f707aab0">notifications</a>, where we send a single post that we think the user might be interested in and want to engage with. As part of sending an email, we need to determine a subject line of the email for the email audiences. Historically, we simply pick the first few words of the post being sent to be the subject line. However, in certain posts, these initial words are often greetings or introductory remarks and may not provide valuable information to the user. In the provided image example below, we observe a simple greeting, “Hello!”</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/707/0*1bUjaLCj0AOjUIe0" /><figcaption>Figure 1.

Prior to the Gen AI systems we build, we use the first words of the post as the subject line (Life and Mother Nature always find a way!)</figcaption></figure><p>In this work, we aim to use Generative AI technologies to improve the subject line. With Generative AI, we aim to generate informative and interesting subject lines that will lead to more email opens, clicks and eventually more sessions.</p><p>Writing a good subject line with Generative AI is challenging because the subject line needs to satisfy the following criteria. First and foremost, the subject line needs to be engaging so that the users want to open the email. To see if ChatGPT API can write engaging subject lines, we tried generating subject lines with ChatGPT API with a small traffic A/B test, and found that the users are less likely to click on emails if we use subject lines made by ChatGPT API (e.g. Table 1). As we show later, we tried to improve the prompts (prompt engineering) but the results were still inferior to the user-generated subjects. This finding implies that Generative AI models are not trained to write the content that is particularly engaging to our users, and we need to guide Generative AI models to increase user engagement.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/991/1*L4Uumzj8svXajgd07AUOtQ.png" /><figcaption>Table 1. Subject line made by ChatGPT API and its CTR. ChatGPT API’s subject line is more informative but looks like a marketing phrase, and produced only 56% clicks compared to the user-generated subject line.</figcaption></figure><p>Second challenge is that the subject line needs to be authentic. If it reads like a marketing phrase, the email will look like spam. The example in Table 1 “Support backyard chickens in Papillion, NE!” shows this issue.</p><p>Third, the subject line should not contain hallucinations (a response that is nonsensical or not accurate). And it is well known that Generative AI is vulnerable to hallucinations [2]. For example, given a very short post saying “Sun bathing ☀️”, ChatGPT API in Table 1 generated the subject line “Soak Up the Sun: Tips for Relaxing Sun Bathing Sessions”, which had nothing to do with the post content.</p><p>We developed a novel Generative AI method to overcome the three challenges faced by the ChatGPT API mentioned above. We made three contributions:</p><ul><li><strong>Prompt engineering to generate authentic subject lines with no hallucination:</strong> Given a post, ChatGPT API creates a subject line by extracting the most interesting phrases of the post without any rewriting. By extracting the user’s original writing, we are able to prevent marketing phrases and hallucinations.</li><li><strong>Rejection sampling with a reward model: </strong>To find the most interesting subject line, we develop a reward model whose job is to predict if the users would prefer a given subject line over other subject lines. After ChatGPT API writes a subject line, we evaluate it by the reward model and accept it only if its reward model score is higher than the user-written subject line’s score. This technique is called Rejection Sampling and recently introduced to Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Model training [1].</li><li><strong>Cost optimization and model accuracy maintenance</strong>: We added engineering components to minimize the serving cost and stabilize the model performance. By using caching, we reduced our cost to 1/600 compared to the brute-force way. By daily performance monitoring, we can catch if reward models fail to predict which subject is more engaging due to external factors such as user preference drift and address it by retraining.</li></ul><p>We believe that this framework is generally applicable when off-the-shelf Generative AI fails to improve user engagement. We also analyzed the importance of each component in our design. Even with the aforementioned prompt engineering, ChatGPT API did not necessarily produce more engaging content. This highlights the necessity of the rejection sampling component: in such cases, we can develop another AI model as a reward model and use the Generative AI’s output only if the reward model approves [1].</p><h3>Proposed Method</h3><p>For every post, we employ the following system to create a subject line. It’s important to mention that we generate a single subject line for each post, without personalization. This decision was made to minimize computational cost. Exploring cost-effective methods for implementing personalized subject lines will be an interesting future work.</p><h4>Model Overview</h4><p>Figure 2 illustrates our approach. We develop two different AI models.</p><ul><li>Subject line generator: This model generates a subject line given a post content.</li><li>Reward model (Evaluator): Given a subject line and the post content, this model predicts if the given subject line would be the better subject line than the user-generated subject line.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/893/1*ejkWUk9i9BBrI74iU7g1XA.png" /><figcaption>Figure 2. Overview of our approach.</figcaption></figure><p>Given a post, the Subject line generator produces subjects in Figure 2 (green boxes). The reward model compares the OpenAI API subject line (green) with the user-generated subject line (red), and selects the more engaging one. For the top post, the OpenAI API subject line contains more relevant information and is selected. For the bottom post which was about a health alert, the reward model selects the user-generated subject. While the OpenAI API subject line shows the main content of the alert, the reward model picks the user-generated subject because it shows the importance of the post and thus is more engaging.</p><h4>Developing Subject Line Generator</h4><p>We use OpenAI API without fine-tuning. In the prompt, we require that OpenAI API extracts the most interesting part of the post without making any change. This way of extracting user content provides multiple benefits: First, it removes hallucinations. Second, it keeps the subject line authentic as OpenAI API does not rewrite the original content. To test the prompt engineering, we A/B tested generator outputs without reward models. We found that asking OpenAI API to extract in the prompt improves Sessions by 3% relatively compared to asking OpenAI API to rewrite the subject line from scratch (See the Results section for the details).</p><h4>Developing Reward Model</h4><p>We fine-tune OpenAI API to develop a reward model. This is the main innovation we applied on top.</p><p><strong>Training data collection: </strong>The challenge is to collect training data on which subject line was more engaging. Manual annotation is not possible because there are no rules deciding what subject line is more engaging. We found that the subject lines that we thought to be more engaging than the user-generated ones turned out to be less engaging (Table 2).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/956/1*WgqJAkjrCROtF0SfXCz4qA.png" /><figcaption>Table 2. Emails with a user-generated subject (left) generated 3x as many clicks as the emails with OpenAI API-generated subjects on the right.</figcaption></figure><p>To tackle this issue, we collect training data via experimentation. For each post, we generate subject lines in two ways. One way is to use user-generated ones and the other is to use the OpenAI API generator described above. Then we serve 2–3% users (~20k) that are randomly selected with each subject line. The goal is to learn which subject line was more engaging through click data.</p><p><strong>Model training:</strong> We used OpenAI API to fine-tune with the labels we collected. We used ~50k examples and 40% of examples had the OpenAI API subject as the winning subject and the rest had the user subject as the winner. Given a subject line and post content, our model is fine-tuned to predict if the subject line would generate more engagement (clicks) than the user-generated subject line. The model is asked to predict if the subject line is more engaging and output “Yes” or “No”.</p><p><strong>Training details:</strong> We used the smallest OpenAI API model “ada” for fine-tuning. We found that larger models did not improve the predictive performance despite higher cost. We added <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5247780-using-logit-bias-to-define-token-probability">a logit bias</a> of 100 for “Yes” and “No”. These biases boost the probability for the model to output “Yes” or “No”. We tried to change the number of epochs and selected the model with 4 epochs, but we did not see much difference in offline performance after 2–3 epochs.</p><p><strong>Engineering details:</strong> We added the following components for optimization and safeguarding.</p><ul><li><strong>Caching: </strong>For each post, we cache the outputs of our model. By processing each post only once, we reduced the cost to 1/600. In other words, each post gets sent 600 times on average and we process the post only once instead of 600 times. Caching also optimizes the OpenAI API usages (the number of tokens and the number of requests).</li><li><strong>Reward model performance maintenance</strong>: We monitor the reward model’s predictive performance daily, using the next day’s user clicks after the training phase as the ground truth to compare with the model’s output. Model’s predictive performance can change because our users’ preference may change and the content in Nextdoor can shift in the writing styles or topics.<br />For monitoring purposes, we collect the engagement performance of different subject lines in the following way. We created a “control” user bucket where we always send emails with the user-generated subject and a “always OpenAI API” bucket where we always send with the OpenAI API subject, regardless of the reward model’s output. From these two buckets, we know the ground-truth on which subject line was more engaging, and measure the reward model’s accuracy. If the accuracy goes down by 10+%, we retrain the reward model with new data.</li><li><strong>Retries with Fallback: </strong>Since OpenAI API may return an error due to the rate limit or transient issues, we added retries with<a href="https://tenacity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"> exponential backoffs with Tenacity</a>. If we fail after a certain number of retries, we fallback to the user-generated subject.</li><li><strong>Controlling the length of output: </strong>We found that the Subject line generator would write a subject line longer than our desired length (10 words). This happened even if we specified the 10 word limit in the instruction and added examples. We post-processed the generator output by cutting the first 10 words from the generator’s output. We A/B tested different word limits and found that 10 is the optimal value.</li></ul><h3>Results</h3><p>We did A/B tests with different versions of the subject line generator, and with and without the reward model. For the generator, we tested the following options</p><ul><li>Writing with OpenAI API: We ask OpenAI API to “write an engaging subject line for a given post”. This was the first version we tested without much prompt engineering.</li><li>Extracting with OpenAI API: We ask OpenAI API to extract the most interesting part and provide 5 examples. We also add requirements in a numbered list such as “Do not insert or remove any word.”, “Do not change capitalization”, “If the first 10 words are interesting, use them as a subject line”. We tried 4 different versions of prompts and picked the best version by A/B test metrics.</li></ul><p>For the A/B test metrics, we primarily focus on Sessions. A session is an activity sequence made by the same user within a certain timeframe, and sessions quantify the number of unique user visits.</p><p>Table 3 shows the results on Session lift compared to the “control” bucket where we use user-generated subject lines. In addition to the session metrics, our final model (last row) increased Weekly Active Users by 0.4% and Ads revenue by 1%.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/955/1*60AFxqFwmZ39d8g2h5NQUw.png" /><figcaption>Table 3. Session lift compared to the user-generated subject lines from A/B tests. The final model (last row) achieved 1% lift in sessions.</figcaption></figure><p>Here is what we learned from A/B tests:</p><ul><li>Prompt engineering improves the performance but has a ceiling. After a few iterations, the A/B test metrics showed only marginal improvements, failing to beat the control.</li><li>Finding the “optimal” prompt is an elusive task, as the space of potential prompts is boundless, making it difficult to explore. Moreover, there is no established algorithmic or systematic method for enhancing prompts. Instead, the task relies on human judgment and intuition to update the prompt.</li><li>Reward model was the key factor in improving sessions.</li><li>Predicting popular content is challenging, as is the reward model’s task of forecasting popular subject lines, which currently achieves about 65% accuracy. Enhancing the reward model’s performance by leveraging real-time signals like the current engagement numbers for the subject can be an interesting future work.</li></ul><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>We developed a novel Generative AI system to increase user engagement by combining the reward model and prompt engineering. Our systems have engineering components for cost saving and monitoring. A/B tests showed that our systems can deliver more engaging subject lines than the user-generated subject lines.</p><p>There are many avenues for future work. First is to fine-tune the subject line generator. In this work, we used vanilla ChatGPT API as the generator. Instead, we can fine tune OpenAI API with the most engaging titles that the reward model identifies. For each post, we generate multiple subject lines and use the reward model to pick the winner. Then we use the winner subject to fine tune the subject line generator. This approach is called Reinforcement Learning by Rejection Sampling [1].</p><p>Second is to rescore the same post daily. Currently, we pick the best subject line with a reward model once and never rescore. However, as time goes on, we may be able to see which of the OpenAI API subject line or user-generated subject line is getting more engagement, and our reward model can predict more accurately. Third is to add personalization without significantly escalating computational costs.</p><h3>Acknowledgments</h3><p>The post was written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaewonyang/">Jaewon Yang</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/qi-he/">Qi He</a>.</p><p>This work was led by the Generative AI team with cross-org collaboration between Notification team and ML teams.

        <h2>From Pre-trained to Fine-tuned: Nextdoor’s Path to Effective Embedding Applications</h2>
        </a>
            
            <p><span class="company">Nextdoor Engineering - Medium</span>: <h3>Background</h3><p>The majority of ML models at Nextdoor are typically driven by a large number of features that are primarily either continuous or discrete in nature. The personalized features usually stem from historical aggregations or real-time summarization of interaction features, typically captured through logged tracking events. However, representing content through deep understanding using information behind it (text/image) is crucial for modeling nuanced user signals and better personalizing complex user behavior across many of our products. In the rapidly evolving field of NLP, utilizing transformer models to perform representation learning effectively and efficiently has become increasingly important for user understanding and improving their product experience.</p><p>Towards that, we have built a lot of entity embedding models spanning entities such as posts, comments, users, search queries &amp; classifieds. We first leveraged deep understanding of content and used that to derive embeddings for meta entities like users based on their past interacted content. These powerful representations are found to be very crucial towards extracting meaningful features for some of the biggest ML ranking systems at Nextdoor such as notifications scoring and feed ranking. By making them readily available and building to scale, we can drive adoption of state-of-the-art reliably and put them in the hands of ML Engineers for rapidly building performant models across the company.</p><p>This blog primarily focuses on how we iterated on the development of embedding models, how they are featurized and served at large scale into various product applications as well as some of the challenges encountered during this process. We summarize the evolution of work across three sections. In section 1, the focus is to leverage state-of-the-art pre-trained models to rapidly evaluate the value of embeddings models as feature extractors. Section 2 describes how to fine-tune embeddings using unlabelled data for certain products, whereas Section 3 demonstrates the use of labeled data to fine-tune embeddings for better task prediction. This work is driven by the Knowledge Graph Team at Nextdoor, a horizontal team that works in close collaboration with product ML teams as well as the ML Platform team who owns the ML training and serving platform and the FeatureStore service powering ML models at Nextdoor.</p><h3>1. Leveraging Pre-trained models</h3><p>The first generation of embeddings are built from pre-trained language models using the Sentence-BERT paradigm (<a href="https://www.sbert.net/">https://www.sbert.net/</a>). SBERT is well-known to produce better embedding representations compared to original BERT models [1]. The main goal here is to rapidly experiment with embeddings as features and realize their value in the product as quickly as possible. The text from content entities, viz. Nextdoor posts &amp; comments, is extracted from post’s subject and body and comment text respectively, which is then fed into a multilingual text embedding model to derive respective entity embeddings for all countries Nextdoor operates in. For a given user, their historical interacted posts’ embeddings are weighted aggregated based on interaction type to inform user (interaction) embedding. Ex: Active interaction such as post creation/comment/click would have higher weight compared to a more passive interaction like impression. These signals are aggregated across both online (feed) and offline (emails) product surfaces to represent user embedding holistically and are updated daily for all users in the platform.</p><p>These features were found to be among the most important features for multiple ranking models and delivered significant performance lifts in key product OKR metrics across both notifications and feed when shipped in early 2022. The pre-trained models also served as a good proof-of-concept to build out reliable feature ingestion pipelines and monitoring systems identifying any potential feature drifts and disruptions. This helped form a robust playbook for deploying several next generation embedding features.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*ov2I6idhPRXzy4im" /></figure><h3>2. Fine-tuned embeddings from unlabeled data</h3><p>The next generation of embeddings describes training custom models which are improvements over pre-trained versions by leveraging techniques of fine-tuning. The signals used to generate embeddings earlier come from user interactions across notifications and home feed products either directly or indirectly. In contrast, this section details a use case that makes use of unlabelled data to perform representation learning to improve user search experience.</p><p>Our neighbors use Nextdoor search to find useful local information by expressing intent explicitly. We tried to capture both long and short term intent to determine and serve user perennial (e.g.: home maintenance) as well as ephemeral needs (e.g.: lost &amp; found). Search queries — while being high intent in nature, are inherently short and noisy. A searcher might try multiple variations of a query successively in order to get their intent fulfilled as much as possible. Additionally, due to the nature of local search, relying on labeled feedback from search results may not fully capture user intent due to limited liquidity.</p><p>To fully capture user intent signals, we rely on a self-supervised training strategy to learn fine-tuned representations for any given query. Specifically, we first built an SBERT backed query embedding model that learns to embed search queries in lower dimensional space. Then, we aggregate embeddings from user queries across different time windows (weekly/monthly/quarterly periods) to generate multiple user (intent) embeddings. The same model also extracts the intent of a post to generate the corresponding post embeddings. The resulting user, post and query embeddings are transformed and featurized as described in the later section to improve the performance of the ranking models.</p><p>The query embedding model is originally built to drive contextual query expansion in Nextdoor search pipeline [2]. This sentence transformer model is trained on historical search queries in order to best learn query representations. We first collected search logs that consisted of sequences of search queries within a session across all searchers over a period of time. Then, they are pre-processed<strong> </strong>using traditional NLP methods like lemmatization, spell checking, deduplication etc. to form a clean corpus of tokens, which is composed of n-grams (n=1,2,3) and whole queries. To generate a training dataset, we created positive pairs of tokens occurring within a user search session and negative pairs randomly occurring across sessions. Contrastive learning with cosine similarity loss is used to train the underlying model.</p><p>For the query expansion use-case, this model drove better contextual search results by identifying related candidates improving recall. This helped not only improve key search metrics across content search and product search in For Sale &amp; Free but also reduced the rate of null queries significantly compared to prior word embedding models. We also leveraged <strong>HSNWlib </strong>[3]<strong>, </strong>an approximate nearest neighbors library to implement this deep learning based query expansion further improving expansion latencies by more than 10x. For notification &amp; feed use cases, intent features generated from transformations of post &amp; user embeddings helped achieve significant positive impact on our top line engagement metrics. Although features can only be computed for searchers and are of low coverage overall, this explicit signal is found to be very useful in improving the overall search experience.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*_JHrrjQ1aOcMHC82" /></figure><h3>3. Fine-tuned embeddings from labeled feedback</h3><p>In the next evolution of embeddings, we additionally leverage user feedback to fine-tune models further. The pre-trained entity embeddings have served us well over a year, but they are off-the-shelf models trained using public benchmark datasets. As such, their semantics are quite different in nature from the Nextdoor domain. Moreover, their high but fixed model dimensionality contributes to significant storage and serving costs, especially when user embeddings are updated for all Nextdoor neighbors daily. To address these, we built a two-tower framework to fine-tune embeddings with user feedback collected across Nextdoor surfaces while reducing<strong> </strong>dimensionality, customizing to our domain, and being cost effective.</p><p>The fine-tuned models are developed and trained in phases, incrementally adding complexity. In the first phase, the inputs to post and user towers are pre-trained embeddings, which are then transformed using multiple FC layers, reducing dimensionality at each step. The standard cross-entropy is used as a loss function to predict the task of notification clicks for a given user and post. To generate a training dataset, we sampled from random explore logs to reduce selection bias, the same process as that of the downstream ranking model. Once the model is fully trained, the last layer generates fine-tuned user and post representations.</p><p>These pytorch models are trained on millions of records using SageMaker GPU instances with varying hyperparameters, and the model with the best offline performance is chosen to generate &amp; store fine-tuned embeddings into FeatureStore. The earlier described playbook is followed to build and monitor offline and online feature pipelines. Serving these cached features to downstream models has shown promising lifts in all engagement metrics (CTR/sessions/contributions/DAU/WAU) while keeping guardrail metrics that measure harmful/hurtful content distribution across the platform neutral.</p><p>In the next phase, we fed the post tower directly with text extracted from the post entity, allowing us to fine-tune parameters of the SBERT model. The test AUC score is used as a benchmark to determine how many layers and transformer blocks to unfreeze for trying out different training schemes along with optimization of hyperparameters of typical DNN models. The best model also improved the user — post cosine similarity of fine-tuned embeddings by up to 16% when compared to respective pre-trained versions — an additional evaluation criteria of intrinsic quality of improvement in representations. It is also noteworthy that this quality improvement is achieved while reducing dimensionality by more than 10x!</p><p>In the most recent phase, we extended into multi-task learning (MTL) setup modeling both notification clicks and feed actions to jointly optimize learning of fine-tuned embeddings. Again, these objectives mimic downstream rankers exactly to make sure learnt embeddings directly optimize downstream tasks. MTL models have the added advantage of learning a single model across multiple product surfaces thereby reducing operational burden and maintenance costs, while leveraging knowledge transfer across shared tasks for better representations. The feed and notifications surfaces are highly related as clicking on email notifications lands directly into the pinned view of the post in the newsfeed. Additionally, most actions on home feed are used as features in notification ranker making these tasks very related<strong>.</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*mMj49F_njQR6-4pA" /></figure><h3>Using embeddings in ML models</h3><p>As most of our downstream production models are tree based models, they don’t directly integrate with vector features like embeddings, like that of Deep neural networks. Therefore, we primarily use outputs from embedding models as feature extractors into downstream models. Specifically, we rely on transformations like cosine similarity &amp; dot products across these entity embeddings in order to generate meaningful affinity features. While transitioning into neural network systems is currently underway — these vector transformations provide a neat way to integrate embedding based features into existing models and enable rapid experimentation for assessing performance lift of new deep features.</p><p>We first create schema and declare feature groups corresponding to each embedding to host within our in-house FeatureStore. Then, content based embedding features are ingested into our Featurestore in near real-time using task worker jobs as they get created/updated. For users, the daily scheduled jobs in Airflow compute embedding aggregations based on pre-specified lookback windows, weighted across various interaction types, and are batch ingested into Featurestore. Once systems are set up to ingest all relevant embeddings with appropriate TTL, we then write logging code to compute and log the derived features such as cosine similarity and dot product between user &amp; post, user &amp; user. Specifically, in feed, these features would represent affinities between post vs viewer, viewer vs author and analogously between post vs recipient, sender vs recipient in notifications world. Similarly, we also compute affinities across comment entities to inform activity based ranking in newsfeed. The data obtained from feature logging is used to train downstream ML ranking models, to avoid online-offline skew, and the model with best offline performance lift with new features is promoted for online AB test evaluation and ramping further towards majority member experience.</p><h3>Challenges &amp; Future</h3><p>Multiple entity embeddings i.e user, post, comment, query etc have been successfully integrated into various product surfaces at Nextdoor at large scale. In the past, models based on comment embeddings helped foster and cultivate kinder conversations to improve platform vitality metrics [4]. More recently, contextual topic embeddings are also developed using BERTopic [5] to achieve coarser level personalization of content to neighbors, while informing us about prevalence of content categories and types across the platform. We are also experimenting with image embeddings using CLIP [6] to leverage image/video information behind content.</p><p>In addition, as an extension to labeled fine-tuning, we plan to further improve representations along two dimensions. One is by concatenating representations with additional features such as image embeddings and existing interaction features to leverage multimodal and dense signals. The other is to extend tasks to other surfaces such as ads, For Sale &amp; Free (marketplace) etc to make representations more holistic across products. Once downstream models are fully modernized to DNN-based methods, the embeddings can be integrated into the model directly without losing any information from computation of transformations.</p><p>As we build more and more embeddings capturing different signals, we also need to be mindful of additional incurred costs from new features. Some of the initial challenges of serving high dimensional vectors during inference are mitigated by performing embedding transformations directly within FeatureStore rather than passing embeddings across microservices minimizing network bandwidth and scaling costs. This worked well with tree based models, however in the future, serving embeddings directly with DNN models can add up costs. Caching and serving fine-tuned embeddings can help control dimensionality while incorporating domain specific knowledge. This allowed us to rapidly experiment and quickly evaluate ROI at a smaller scale, justifying overall costs. From an infra standpoint, we found that optimizing the payload format of embedding features as well as sequencing of calls to efficiently read/write from FeatureStore greatly reduces overall costs at full scale.</p><h3>Acknowledgments</h3><p>This work would not have been possible without close cooperation and collaboration with various ML product partners (Notifications/Feed/Search/Vitality) as well as significant support for ML platform and FeatureStore service from ML Platform team. I would like to take this opportunity to give a huge shoutout to all the dedicated Nextdoor folks from these teams behind this endeavor.</p><p>Nextdoor is building the largest Local Knowledge Graph (LKG) in the world. The local knowledge graph inherited in our neighborhoods is Nextdoor’s unique proprietary data that can be used to enable personalized neighborhood and neighbor experiences. The Knowledge Graph team is focused on understanding neighbors and content by creating standardized neighbor/content data using state-of-the-art ML methods.</p><p>Third-party large language models (LLMs) such as GPT and the corresponding dialogue applications like ChatGPT, which are built upon these language models, lack access to the specific local knowledge of Nextdoor. As a result, they are unable to offer location-based services to our users as we desire. It is crucial for us to develop in-house custom LLMs that leverage our unique local knowledge graphs. We are building our own large language models (LLMs), that are based on top of Nextdoor’s raw content and the structured knowledge graph to power multiple products.</p><p>Please reach out to us if you are interested to learn more — we are hiring!</p><h3>References</h3><ol><li>Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks</li><li><a href="https://engblog.nextdoor.com/modernizing-our-search-stack-6a56ab87db4e">https://engblog.nextdoor.com/modernizing-our-search-stack-6a56ab87db4e</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib">https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib</a></li><li><a href="https://engblog.nextdoor.com/using-predictive-technology-to-foster-constructive-conversations-4af437942bd4">https://engblog.nextdoor.com/using-predictive-technology-to-foster-constructive-conversations-4af437942bd4</a></li><li><a href="https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/api/bertopic.html">https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/api/bertopic.html</a></li><li><a href="https://openai.com/research/clip">https://openai.com/research/clip</a></li></ol><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3a13b56d91aa" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://engblog.nextdoor.com/from-pre-trained-to-fine-tuned-nextdoors-path-to-effective-embedding-applications-3a13b56d91aa">From Pre-trained to Fine-tuned: Nextdoor’s Path to Effective Embedding Applications</a> was originally published in <a href="https://engblog.nextdoor.com">Nextdoor Engineering</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p></p>

        <h2>Catching Anomalies Early in Mobile App Releases</h2>
        </a>
            
            <p><span class="company">Nextdoor Engineering - Medium</span>: <h4><em>How Nextdoor catches mobile app release anomalies at 1% adoption</em></h4><p>At Nextdoor, our mobile applications on iOS and Android serve content to tens of millions of weekly active users. At this scale, we run a weekly release process for both iOS and Android, shipping hundreds of changes across multiple teams and dozens of mobile engineers.</p><p>Our team uses several observability processes and rollout strategies to keep these deployments safe and scalable. We most notably use phased rollouts to minimize the impact of a potentially bad release. Phased rollouts allow us to gradually increase the adoption of users for a new app version. For example, we can have a new app version be released to only 1% of users on the 1st day, 2% of users on the 2nd day, and so on. That way, if a new release were accidentally shipped with an uncaught regression, having it at 1% rollout means it affects fewer users, reduces its severity level, and gives us more time to react.</p><p>However, for many of our critical business metrics where a failure can sometimes be silent, most out-of-the-box observability approaches don’t work with phased rollouts. This is largely due to two problems:</p><ol><li>Observability typically happens at an aggregate level. For example, we look at app sessions or revenue on a daily basis, across all users for a platform.</li><li>The behavior of early adopters on an app version differs from the median behavior of all users. Most importantly, early adopters are more active, almost by definition, to be in an early rollout of the new app version.</li></ol><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*H3TvnakvfRDZVSjj" /></figure><p><em>At Nextdoor, Daily Users are more likely to adopt releases over Weekly Users, Weekly Users over Monthly Users, and so on.</em></p><p>For example, consider an app session regression on a hypothetical iOS version v1.234.5 released March 4. If we had unknowingly introduced a regression where we didn’t count an app session 5% of the time, at a 1% rollout, our aggregate impact would be expected to be roughly 0.05 x 0.01 = 0.05% of all iOS app sessions, which is practically impossible to detect (read: noise) with aggregate-level observability. Even worse, early app adopters skew more active, which means that maybe we should expect 0.06% of all sessions impacted. Or maybe 0.07% of all sessions impacted. In short, it’s hard to tell exactly what our aggregate impact should be.</p><p>However, when iOS release v1.234.5 reaches full rollout in a week, a 5% app session regression would be business critical. We can detect the app sessions drop once it reaches full rollout by looking at week-over-week or month-over-month metrics, but by that point, several days would have passed.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*NKh107Qd6XbC9TfR" /></figure><p><em>Stacked graph. Top trendline shows our app sessions, which has a clear regression starting March 7 with a low point at March 14. Bottom trendline shows the release adoption over time due to phased rollouts.</em></p><p><strong>How can we detect these issues on day 1, at 1% rollout?</strong></p><p>A simple approach would be to normalize our business metrics to the total number of users on the release, and turn all metrics into relative metrics (e.g. on v1.234.5, app sessions per active user per app version). Unfortunately, as mentioned earlier, we can’t directly compare the app sessions from users who have adopted a release to those who haven’t as their underlying characteristics are too different.</p><p>What we’re trying to solve for these early adopters is: what is the difference between their actual app sessions after adoption compared with their hypothetical app sessions had they never adopted the release in the first place, or an unobserved counterfactual? In statistics, we can measure this through difference-in-differences analysis.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*y70c1GVEQpu4G5V_" /></figure><p><em>For iOS release v1.234.5, app sessions over time of users who adopted the new app release on March 4 (teal) vs app sessions over time of users who did not adopt (gray).</em></p><p>Difference-in-differences analysis is a simple causal inference method we can apply here to estimate this effect by accounting for the separate time varying effects of users that have and have not adopted a release:</p><ol><li>For users who adopted the release, calculate the difference in their app sessions three days before and three days after the release period. In this case, we observed a<strong> -0.02 decline</strong> in app sessions.</li><li>Do the same for users that have not adopted the release. In this case, a <strong>+0.20 increase</strong> in app sessions.</li></ol><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*4KE35DeHtV08YHOM" /></figure><p>Assuming trends would have otherwise remained constant (pre-trend assumption), we would have expected app sessions of release adopters to increase by<strong> +0.20</strong> like we observed with non-adopters. However, they instead <em>decreased</em> by<strong> -0.02</strong>. We calculate the difference in differences to estimate a comparison against an unobserved counterfactual:</p><blockquote><strong><em>-0.02–0.20 = -0.22 decrease in app sessions due to iOS release v1.234.5</em></strong></blockquote><p>In practice, we don’t just calculate this in aggregate. We first make sure that our two cohorts exhibit similar behavior pre-adoption (pre-trend assumption). This is a critical step to difference-in-differences analysis. With a sample size over hundreds of thousands of users, we can achieve high confidence in similar pre-trend behavior with a simple standard deviation bound over the preceding few days to adoption. If this behavior holds, we then fit a linear regression model that estimates the average effect of a release for any particular metric:</p><p><strong><em>y = β0 + β1* Time_Period + β2* Treated + β3*(Time_Period*Treated) + e</em></strong></p><p>In the case of v1.234.5, we can measure statistically significant negative effects across multiple app sessions metrics.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*iSb6LoW7N78q5X9W" /></figure><p><em>Average % lift of metrics we ran App Release Anomaly Detection on for v1.234.5</em></p><p>With this difference-in-differences approach, we are now able to flag the app sessions decline due to v1.234.5 on March 5th, <strong>10 days earlier</strong> than we normally would have been able to using week over week figures. We also mitigate the need to factor in external variables such as seasonality or day of week. This not only helps in diagnosing the source of the decline to a specific app release, it also isolates the regression to <strong>less than 1% of iOS users</strong>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Odg2PLNhkrLvAL2F" /></figure><p><em>App Release Anomaly Detection allowed us to discover and fix the release regression at 1% rollout, before our aggregate observability even showed a drop.</em></p><p>App Release Anomaly Detection is one of the many tools we’ve built at Nextdoor to give us observability into our releases while iterating quickly. It is one of the foundational elements that allows us to deploy major app releases on a weekly cadence and have confidence in our stability. Operationalized, App Release Anomaly Detection has helped us prevent nearly all severe critical client-side regressions and gives us peace of mind to release bigger changes at a more rapid cadence.</p><p>If this type of cross-functional work between platform engineering and data science at scale interests you, we’re hiring!

        <h2>Typeahead Search at Nextdoor</h2>
        </a>
            
            <p><span class="company">Nextdoor Engineering - Medium</span>: <h3>Background</h3><p>In a thriving community, people are connected to their friends and local businesses. Nextdoor is the hyperlocal platform that mirrors these offline relationships. Every day, through active discussions on the platform, new relationships are formed and existing ones strengthened.</p><p>For example, a Nextdoor user can create a post like “I really like @<strong>XYZ cafe</strong>. @<strong>John</strong> is a hard working business owner and we should all support him by buying a cup of delicious latte!” Here, the post is created by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/15/nextdoor-revamps-with-new-profiles-feed-and-more-community-building-features/?guccounter=1#:~:text=Neighborhood%20members%20will%20also%20be%20able%20to%20connect%20and%20%40mention%20one%20another%20in%20posts%20and%20comments%2C%20similar%20to%20other%20social%20networks%2C%20like%20Twitter%20or%20Facebook.">at-mentioning</a> (via the @ symbol) nearby businesses and users. From this post, users in the neighborhood can contribute by at-mentioning others to be part of the comment threads. As a result, John’s cafe thrives and acts as a neighborhood hub where new friends are made.</p><p>Every month, millions of these mentions are created in various discussions (including <a href="https://youtu.be/PYfT7d3ZSw4?t=801">lost dogs</a>!). In addition to posts and comments, a user can type into the search box and see, among other things, nearby users and businesses. All these features are powered by the same autocomplete service — a set of APIs to ingest data and handle typeahead search of different entity types (businesses, users, keywords etc) on Nextdoor.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*C5UxSGX9xQlUeIYP3f78qg.png" /></figure><p>This post focuses on how we built a proximity-based typeahead service to power typeahead use cases at Nextdoor.</p><h3><strong>Proximity-Based Typeahead Search as a Service</strong></h3><p>Any good search experience can be boiled down to two core components:</p><ol><li>Relevance: Given a search query, whether the user sees relevant results or not. As a hyperlocal social network, relevancy is heavily weighted by geo proximity.</li></ol><p>2. Low latency. <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/07/velocity-making-your-site-fast.html">Google Search</a> found that</p><blockquote><em>a 400 millisecond delay resulted in a -0.59% change in searches/user. What’s more, even after the delay was removed, these users still had -0.21% fewer searches, indicating that a slower user experience affects long term behavior.</em></blockquote><p>For a good autocomplete experience, as users type, relevant results should show up instantaneously.</p><p>To meet the product requirements, we set out to build a service with the following design goals:</p><ol><li>Low latency. There are hundreds of millions of entities on Nextdoor. The search latency at the service level should be less than 50ms.</li><li>Horizontally scalable to meet future scaling needs (we scale by adding more nodes).</li><li>Extensible. Typeahead search is a foundational API that enables other product features, so it should be easy to add other types of entities in the future.</li><li>High throughput for writes. We want to be able to index hundreds of millions of entities in a matter of hours.</li><li>Ease of operation and maintenance. When we index records, we should not impact production traffic.</li></ol><h3><strong>Implementation</strong></h3><p>We landed on an in-memory-based solution that leverages geohash. At a high level, geohashing divides the earth into multiple zones based on latitude and longitude. It provides a good way to shard a large data set into buckets based on a <a href="https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/restable/">zoomed-in level</a>. Entities in the same bucket are in close proximity.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/577/0*SwpBX3o9lg-atIFK" /></figure><p>We used Uber’s open source geohashing library called <a href="https://h3geo.org/">H3</a>.</p><p>For handling typeahead search, we decided to use <a href="https://redis.io/docs/manual/data-types/#sorted-sets">sorted sets</a>. This gives a set of benefits:</p><ol><li>In-memory storage gives us the best possible latency characteristics for handling typeahead search.</li><li>It is easy to maintain. We can rely on<a href="https://redis.io/topics/persistence"> redis persistence</a> without having to handle durability ourselves.</li><li>By following the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html">CQRS</a>) pattern, we are able to index hundreds of millions of entities in a matter of hours with no impact to the serving of production traffic. Ingestion is handled by redis primary nodes in the cluster, and updates are then replicated to the read-only nodes which handle the typeahead search. Replication lag is less than 10ms.</li></ol><p>With these two core pieces in place, we built a set of APIs that work together to handle all aspects of typeahead search:</p><p>* indexing_api (ingestion)</p><p>* typeahead_api (search)</p><p>* ranking_api (ranking by entity types)</p><h3><strong>Ingestion Path</strong></h3><p>Here is an example of the ingestion flow for businesses (Starbucks with id: 5, latitude: 47, and longitude -122):</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/752/0*dOmpgMTb5QX3S94f" /></figure><p>For users, the typeahead search API works for both first- or last-name prefixes. Here is an example of the ingestion flow for users (Steve Jobs with id 4, latitude 47, and longitude -122):</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/752/0*msxJfITfOraJZrkw" /></figure><h3><strong>Query Path</strong></h3><p>With the above structure in place, typeahead search retrieves results with a simple look-up using entity type, geohash key, and prefix. We then hydrate and rank the results before returning them to the client.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/821/0*6qzz9RRNnHBJqZlo" /></figure><h3><strong>What we have today</strong></h3><p>The service has been running since August 2021. Every month we are handling hundreds of millions of typeahead search requests, and millions of comments with at-mentions are created. The service level for P95 search latency is less than 30ms.</p><h3><strong>Future work: typeahead for 1+ degree connections</strong></h3><p>To handle typeahead search with 1+ degrees (friends of friends), we can</p><ol><li>Get a list of 1st degree connections.</li><li>For each user in the connection from step 1, get their connections.</li><li>Aggregate these connections and perform typeahead by prefix.</li></ol><p>To reduce the network round trip between the first and successive calls, we can leverage <a href="https://redis.io/docs/manual/programmability/eval-intro/">Lua</a> for edge computing.</p><h3>Acknowledgement</h3><p>It takes a team to move mountains!

        <h2>Modernizing Nextdoor Search Stack — Part 2</h2>
        </a>
            
            <p><span class="company">Nextdoor Engineering - Medium</span>: <h3>Modernizing Nextdoor Search Stack — Part 2</h3><p>In our last blog post of the Modernizing Nextdoor Search Stack series, we explained the Query Understanding and the ML models that power our Query Understanding Engine. We also covered the nuances of the Search at Nextdoor and what it takes to understand the customer intent. This time, we will be focusing on the retrieval of the search results and ranking.</p><h3>Retrieval</h3><p>Retrieval of information can take many forms. Users can express their information needs in the form of a text query — by typing into a search bar, by selecting a query from autocomplete, or in some cases a query may not even be explicit. Retrieval can involve ranking existing pieces of content, such as documents or short-text answers, or composing new responses incorporating retrieved information. At Nextdoor, we work on the information retrieval given the features that we capture or infer from the Query Understanding stage.</p><p>The Query Understanding stage provides us with rich data about the customer intent and context. Query Understanding metadata consists of raw information we get from the user such as device, location, time of the day, day of the week, query itself, expanded queries, embedded version of the query, intent for the query, predicted vertical, and predicted topic of the query, to name a few.</p><p>We combine all of this information in the form of a query that we use for the recall. Our underlying retrieval engine is Elasticsearch. Considering the scale of Nextdoor and the amount of data that we produce each day, we need to ensure that the system that we build meets latency requirements. For that purpose, data for our verticals is split into multiple indices and redistributed across Elasticsearch clusters. High-level overview of our search indices can be viewed through the following diagram.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/623/1*_5OfNJGZ9_DjdkPa5Rd0dA.png" /><figcaption>Nextdoor Search Recall</figcaption></figure><p>All of our reads and writes to Elasticsearch are run through the homegrown Nextdoor Elasticsearch Service (NESS). Our engine uses rich metadata from Query Understanding mentioned above, and for each vertical that we support we will construct comprehensive Elasticsearch queries that will be responsible for the retrieval. Respective queries are fanned out to the respective clusters to get candidates that we will use for ranking. In order to scale operations of the Elasticsearch cluster, at this phase, we operate only with respective entity ids. In other words, retrieval will return only entity ids.</p><h3>Ranking</h3><p>Once we get the results from the retrieval engine, ranking of the candidates is suboptimal. Hence, we introduce a ranking stage in order to optimize search results based on the document features and customer preferences.</p><p>When engineers introduce ML ranking stages in existing systems, complexity of the system increases. Newly introduced stages require that the fetching of the features and inferences is extremely performant. The ranking features for the entities need to be at our disposal with minimal impact on performance of the search. For this, we leverage the Real-Time version of our Feature Store. Feature retrieval happens at the stage that happens before we run inference. We call a Feature Store to get respective raw, statistical features, or embeddings representations of the user, hoods, documents and user document interactions.</p><p>The Nextdoor platform was built more than 10 years ago. Since then, it has collected tons of data, which means the search team has a lot of data to train our model on. When it comes to ranking, our team AB tested ML ranking by leveraging various features and ranking algos.</p><p>To order the search results, we must find the best order for the list of documents for a given user, otherwise known as the ranking problem. The ranking problem is defined as a derivation of ordering over a list of examples that maximizes the utility of the entire list.</p><p>For this purpose, we used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_to_rank">Learning To Rank</a> (LTR). LTR attempts to learn a scoring function that maps example feature vectors to real-valued scores from labeled data, documents D = {d1, d2, .., dn} and respective input features Xi where i is between 1 and n.</p><p>Given the list, the aim of the LTR is to find an optimal scoring function F such that loss over the objective function is minimal. Features of the documents are both traditional and deep.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/498/0*6XcQXbj7hUZKGvun" /></figure><p>To find the right discrimination function between positive and negative samples we use a surrogate problem, which is how to fit the hyperplane between positive and negative training samples. However, loss function and real-world evaluation metrics are not easily comparable. Bridging the gap between evaluation metrics and loss functions has been studied actively in the past. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MSR-TR-2010-82.pdf">LambdaRank</a>, or its tree-based variant LambdaMART, has been one of the most effective algorithms to incorporate ranking metrics in the learning procedure.</p><p>The basic idea is to dynamically adjust the loss during the training based on ranking metrics.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/392/0*TUYkwUhQFxbAltqz" /><figcaption><em>Image from </em><a href="https://appliedmachinelearning.blog/2017/03/09/understanding-support-vector-machines-a-primer/"><em>appliedmachinelearning.blog</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>At Nextdoor, we leverage LGBMRanker implementation from <a href="https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/">LightGBM</a>. During the offline and online evaluation, this model showcased as a great candidate given the tradeoff between accuracy and latencies.</p><h3>Final thoughts</h3><p>Working at search is very exciting, there are many challenges. From scaling the retrieval infrastructure and building ML model inferences, to the ever-changing nature of search at Nextdoor. During this work we managed to bring an amazing group of people together to build a better search experience for our neighbors, with the overall goal to build a kinder world.</p><p>At the same time, there are many interesting challenges ahead of us with regards to scaling our infrastructure, understanding our customers better, introducing new stages of the search ranking, like multi-objective optimization and reinforcement-learning, just to name a few.</p><p>If you find any of these topics interesting and you would like to join our team, please visit our <a href="https://about.nextdoor.com/careers/">careers page</a> to find our open roles.</p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=82192221ad3b" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://engblog.nextdoor.com/modernizing-nextdoor-search-stack-part-2-82192221ad3b">Modernizing Nextdoor Search Stack — Part 2</a> was originally published in <a href="https://engblog.nextdoor.com">Nextdoor Engineering</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p></p>

            <p><span class="company">Nextdoor Engineering - Medium</span>: <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/300/1*h-6AnikkHRV57PSQrvBrQA.png" /></figure><p>Nextdoor’s purpose is to cultivate a kinder world where everyone has a neighborhood they can rely on. We want to give neighbors ways to connect and be kind to each other, online and in real life. One of the biggest levers we have for cultivating more neighborly interactions is by building strategic nudges throughout the product to encourage <a href="https://time.com/collection/time100-companies-2022/6159411/nextdoor-leaders/">kinder conversations</a>.</p><p>Today, we use a number of mechanisms to encourage kindness on the platform, including pop-up reminders that slow neighbors down before responding negatively. Over the past few years, we’ve used machine learning models to identify uncivil and contentious content.</p><p>Nextdoor’s definition of harmful and hurtful content is anything containing uncivil, fraudulent, unsafe, or unwelcoming, including personal attacks, misinformation and discrimination. In partnership with key experts and academics, we identified various moments that add friction on the platform and implemented those findings with our machine learning technology. Our goal: to encourage neighbors to conduct more mindful conversations. What if we can be proactive and intervene before the conversations spark more abusive responses? Oftentimes unkind comments beget more unkind comments. 90% of abusive comments appear in a thread with another abusive comment, and 50% of abusive comments appear in a thread with 13+ other abusive comments.* By preventing some of these comments before they happen, we can avoid the resulting negative feedback loops.</p><p>Nextdoor’s thread model was built to identify potentially contentious conversations, and where intervention might prevent abusive content. The <a href="https://blog.nextdoor.com/2019/09/18/announcing-our-new-feature-to-promote-kindness-in-neighborhoods/">Kindness Reminder</a>, introduced in 2019, and <a href="https://blog.nextdoor.com/2021/04/19/nextdoor-launches-anti-racism-notification-to-prevent-discriminatory-language/">Anti-Racism Notification</a>, launched in 2021, automatically detect offensive or racist language in written comments and encourage the author to edit before it is published. The new <a href="https://about.nextdoor.com/press-releases/nextdoor-launches-new-neighbor-features-to-increase-transparency-and-encourage-constructive-conversations/">Constructive Conversations Reminder</a> uses predictive technology to anticipate when a comment thread may become heated before a neighbor contributes. Below we will share details on how we build the model powering the intervention tools.</p><p><strong>What is a thread? </strong>Nextdoor conversation threads occur inside a post. Once a neighbor creates a post, other neighbors can comment on the post or respond to each other’s comments.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/420/1*zzfpfttbPOk711DqKOQPAA.png" /></figure><p>Neighbors see the comments ordered sequentially and can reply to existing comments. Often, tagging was also used to clarify when the comment is replying to a previous comment further back in the conversation.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/420/1*XYlnEYyNfRaHsmz536bCpg.png" /></figure><p>The multiple dimensions of this conversation created some complexity around how we define each comment’s parent node and traverse along the parent nodes to recreate the conversation thread. Based on our analysis, we found that the most predictive representation considers all the relationships: mentions or tags, reply to comment hierarchy, and sequential order.</p><p><strong>Data</strong></p><p>Labels</p><p>How do we identify when a conversation is becoming contentious? On Nextdoor, neighbors can report content, and volunteer community moderators help to review and remove content based on our <a href="https://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/community-guidelines?language=en_US">Community Guidelines</a>. For somes cases such as misinformation and discrimination, these reports are sent directly to our trained Neighborhood Operation Staff to review. For the purpose of this model, we decided to use reporting rather than removal as a signal because we wanted a tool to detect early signals of conversations going off the tracks. Regardless of the moderator’s decision to keep or remove a comment, we can assume if the conversation triggers a report it will warrant intervention to prevent potentially contentious responses from being created in that thread. Therefore, for each thread, we chose the creation of a subsequent reported comment as a positive label.</p><p>Sampling</p><p>Our training data was sampled across multiple months. Less than 1% of comments get reported, and the reported comments tend to cluster together, so this an imbalanced dataset.* To improve the model, we needed to oversample the positive labels, but doing so in a way that results in a representative distribution of comments from different threads. Comments, especially reported comments, tend to cluster around larger, trending threads, and if we sampled randomly we knew we may not get data representative of the many different types of conversations on Nextdoor. We took two steps in the sampling to create a balanced representation of comments from different threads with positive/negative labels. First we sampled by post, and then within the comment thread for each post, we sampled both negative and positive labels.</p><p><strong>Model architecture</strong></p><p>Features</p><p>The key feature in our model is the comment text. There are other features such as the number of reports on a neighbor’s previous content, and comment creation velocity that adds signal, but we found that most of the AUC gains can be made by picking the appropriate thread structure and generating text embeddings from that structure. In future iterations of the model, we aim to make the other features available to the model.</p><p>Embedding selection</p><p>The embedding, which creates a vector representation of the texts, is an important component of the features. We considered using two different technologies for the embeddings, Fasttext and Bert, comparing their pros and cons listed below:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kCX6HZrPQaANPwcSR5Tm9A.png" /></figure><p>One of the advantages of Bert is that we can leverage pretrained multilingual aligned embeddings that allows a task model trained on U.S. data alone to perform in other languages and countries. Although Bert model has higher latency than Fasttext, ultimately, we decided it was worth the trade-off because the new features and applications we’ll be running off the model can run asynchronously.</p><p>Below describes the architecture for the system. We’re able to tolerate the higher latency at inference time by pre-generating and storing the embedding features, caching scores to be consumed later and delaying downstream tasks dependent on the embeddings.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*3NJsUrr8VNtFQr6V" /></figure><p>The classifier itself is a simple dense neural layer built on top of the concatenated embeddings:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/420/1*BC_4qYIzRJV9LGTYVyJQTw.png" /></figure><p>We built the embedding features using the <a href="https://www.sbert.net/examples/training/multilingual/README.html">sBert API</a>, and experimented with various fine-tuning approaches that might improve the performance. We will discuss the exploration of multilingual embeddings in future blog posts.</p><p><strong>Model performance</strong></p><p>This model was tasked with predicting whether a future comment on a thread will be abusive. This is a difficult task without any features provided on the target comment. Despite the challenges of this task, the model had a relatively high AUC over 0.83, and was able to achieve double digit precision and recall at certain thresholds.</p><p>Below are some examples of comments from threads, and how the model predicted the abusive risk level for these threads:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*iftc_s54mZGa6ds9JC9Sxg.png" /></figure><p>We can see the model is generally able to identify as comments become more contentious. There is an overall limit on the model’s precision rate, due to low incidence of reporting and challenge of predicting an unknown future comment. Not all abusive content gets reported, as the reporting is primarily driven by the norms of the community, and neighbor awareness of the reporting feature. As a result, we may see a higher false positive rate (unreported comments that model label as highly contentious). A human review of a random sample of this group suggests that these false positive comments are often similar in contentious levels as the true positives.</p><p><strong>Internationalization</strong></p><p>Once we were able to validate the model in the U.S., the next step was internationalization. The Bert model we selected includes <a href="https://www.sbert.net/docs/training/multilingual.html">multilingual-aligned embeddings</a>, which was built using the teacher-student model. This model aligns embeddings with similar meaning in different languages to the same vector space. For example “Hello neighbors!” and “Hola vecinos!” would map to similar dimensions.</p><p>We found through both offline validation and online A/B testing that even in the U.S., tasks trained on multilingual-aligned embeddings can perform just as well as those trained on English-only embeddings.</p><p>We also tested the U.S. model on data from other languages and countries because as Nextdoor continues to expand to other countries and languages, we want our models to be available in each market. We evaluated the U.S.-trained model on multiple countries in Europe where we have a relatively higher adoption rate.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3PsbxZ0WmHBniYNdYAWWGQ.png" /></figure><p>In all countries, with the exception of the Netherlands, we found that the AUC was quite close to U.S. levels. Even in the Netherlands, the performance provided enough signal to test on our products. We did notice a slightly lower precision and recall rate overall in Europe, which could be due to lower reporting rates as compared to the U.S.</p><p>Below are some examples of the texts from international threads that were flagged as potentially turning contentious (modified to protect privacy). As you can see, despite cultural and language differences, for the most part, the model was still able to pick up on contentious conversations.</p><ul><li>“I don’t share your faith in Brexit …”</li><li>“Clearly ignorant of science and facts and harming their own business.”</li><li>“Your own comment contradicts itself…”</li><li>“La vérité fâche…” <em>(the truth hurts</em>)</li><li>“je draait om mijn vraag heen” (<em>you’re avoiding my question</em>)</li><li>“io ti ho scritto esattamente ció che avevo scritto in quei commenti che dici che ho cancellato…” (I wrote you exactly what I wrote in those comments that you say I delete)</li></ul><p>Ultimately, the performance won’t match the same level as models trained directly on international data, but the current performance is sufficient signal for some of our moderation intervention tools. One caveat for this analysis is that we only evaluated on western countries where we had adequate data. Therefore, it is unclear whether or not these results will translate for non-western cultures and languages.</p><p>The ability to predict abusive threads in other languages means that even in countries with sparse data for training, we can transfer what we’ve learned from U.S. data for intervention signals. This will allow us to expand our moderation tools across the globe.</p><p><strong>Impact</strong></p><p>We found that this signal, when accurately predicted, can be be leveraged by a variety of different product tools to decrease uncivil content:</p><ol><li><strong>Comment notification suppression</strong>: If a conversation is going awry, suppress notification on the triggering comment</li><li><strong>Constructive Conversations Reminder</strong>: Prompt neighbors to take an empathetic stance when they are about to comment in a contentious thread</li></ol><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/320/1*adpUQrB2ajqbycdiBOJg1Q.png" /></figure><p><strong>3. Prompt author to close discussion</strong>: Remind the post authors they have the ability to close discussion</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/320/1*QNGRl_wiYZnnk4uZ2D7p9g.png" /></figure><ul><li>Once we deployed the model, we were able to start testing some of the intervention methods mentioned above. So far, our results have demonstrated that the model can perform quite well. Comment notification suppression has been rolled out, and Constructive Conversations Reminder has begun rolling out to neighbors in the U.S.</li></ul><p>We hope to continue to leverage these findings to expand our toolbox and Nextdoor is a kind and welcoming platform for all neighbors.

        <h2>Launch Control at Nextdoor</h2>
        </a>
            
            <p><span class="company">Nextdoor Engineering - Medium</span>: <p><strong>How engineers configure and deploy A/B tests and feature flags</strong></p><p>In this article, we share our experience building Launch Control, Nextdoor’s combined feature flagging and experiment configuration tool. One of Nextdoor’s core values is “Experiment and Learn Quickly”, and one of our engineering principles is “<a href="https://engblog.nextdoor.com/engineering-principles-at-nextdoor-e82743b2ef2f">Move Fast — Build Iteratively</a>”. We believe fast iteration on our products and features is a great way to bring better value to our neighbors around the world. Teams at Nextdoor routinely use data from countless experiments to inform product improvements. Moreover, in an environment where it’s impractical to ship native mobile apps more than about once per week, we also make frequent use of feature flags as a way to safely and gradually release new products to our neighbors. Both of these needs — experimentation and feature flagging — require robust internal tools and strong developer education to be used at scale.</p><p>One of the most unique things about Launch Control is how it was built as a strong and ongoing cross-functional collaboration between engineers from all different teams. Its creation came about when a backend product engineer identified opportunities to make the legacy AB and Feature Config tools better. Although they didn’t officially work on internal tools, we strongly believe in ownership and empowerment at Nextdoor, so we ensured they had the space and support to quickly iterate on a prototype. Once this prototype had enough features to get adoption, we made more and more room for that engineer to contribute, and made sure to recognize their impact to Nextdoor engineering.</p><p>After this, Launch Control grew into a shared labor of love across Nextdoor — it has key contributions from many of our best engineers across different teams and stacks, from its core backend components, through a delightful React-powered user interface, all the way to its APIs that integrate experiments and feature flags into our Android and iOS mobile apps. A recurring ritual in Launch Control development is to empower and support engineers who identify ongoing feature improvements to make those improvements themselves. This generates a strong sense of camaraderie across teams and helps spread technical knowledge of how the Launch Control stack works.</p><p><strong>Evolving two internal tools into one</strong></p><p>Before Launch Control, we used two separate tools for experimentation and feature flagging, creatively named Feature Config and AB. These tools suffered from a number of technical limitations. For example, Feature Config allowed engineers to use a rich set of user features, such as their Nextdoor neighborhood, country, or app version, but only produced a binary true/false decision, making it impractical for experiments which need multiple treatment groups. In contrast, the AB tool could output custom treatment groups, but its targeting capabilities were limited to basic percentage-based rollouts.</p><p>Additionally, both tools had sparse and uninviting user interfaces, making it difficult for non-technical users to read, or contribute to, experiments and flags. Launch Control was designed to supersede these tools, with a friendly user interface, and a rich set of targeting capabilities, as well as support for arbitrary treatment groups.</p><p><strong>Launch Control: easy to understand user targeting</strong></p><p>At its core, each individual Launch Control experiment represents a function whose inputs are a set of parameters about a Nextdoor neighbor, such as their id, city, mobile platform, etc., and whose output is a specific <em>treatment group</em>:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*mVk6RxmoPnUZ28opHLdZGw.png" /><figcaption><em>Each Launch Control experiment encodes a mapping between parameters about a Nextdoor neighbor and a specific treatment group for that experiment.</em></figcaption></figure><p>When deciding how to encode these functions, we tried to strike a balance between simplicity and expressive power. Our legacy Feature Config tool, for example, allows arbitrarily nested boolean and/or clauses which check for things such as country allow-lists and percentage rollouts. Unfortunately, that tool made it difficult to express complex relationships in a readable way, leading us to occasionally mistarget rollouts, and discouraging non-technical employees from participating in experimentation.</p><p>For Launch Control, we found that a non-nesting linear sequence of <em>Condition Blocks</em>, each of which is a combination of targeting features, is a great balance between readability and targeting power. When evaluating a particular Launch Control, the algorithm iterates over an experiment’s Condition Blocks, stopping at the first block which successfully captures a user. That block then assigns a specific treatment group to the user, and evaluation ends. In the case that no Condition Block captures a user, Launch Control automatically returns the reserved “untreated” treatment group for that user, indicating that they are not part of the A/B test, or should not get the feature flag in question.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*bTEuymNRH9K0LxUYfvoB3A.png" /><figcaption><em>Condition Blocks are and-combinations of individual targeting features, evaluated from top to bottom. Launch Control assigns a treatment group based on the first Condition Block that “captures” a user.</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Condition Blocks: the heart of Launch Control</strong></p><p>Launch Control supports many different types of Condition Blocks, which allow for targeting based on a variety of user features:</p><ul><li><strong>Individual allow-lists:</strong> These blocks allow us to target individual Nextdoor users. This is particularly useful in the early stages of developing a new feature, as we can target internal team members for dogfooding and testing long before the feature is ready for prime-time.</li><li><strong>Percentage-based rollouts: </strong>Percentage rollouts allow us to encode things like standard A/B tests, where we introduce a new feature to a small subset of our users, comparing those users’ key metrics with a similar-sized control group. In addition, percentage rollouts also give us the ability to gradually release improvements to our users, a few percentage points at a time.</li><li><strong>Geo-targeting: </strong>Some Condition Blocks allow us to target users based on their neighborhood’s city, state, and country. This allows us to iterate on features we decide to launch at different times for different markets (e.g., if we want to iterate on copy for international markets separately from the US).</li><li><strong>Delegation:</strong> It’s possible to configure a Condition Block that delegates its decision to another Launch Control experiment. This allows teams to build a hierarchy of flags, providing an easy-to-use mechanism for feature switches that are progressively broader.</li></ul><p>There is some interesting nuance in how a stochastic, percentage-based Condition Block needs to work. For most features, we expect the same user to <em>always be either in, or out</em>, of an experiment. It would be unreasonable to make a random selection every time a user is evaluated in a condition block, as users would be surprised when they occasionally find themselves jumping between having and not having a new product experience! Launch Control ensures this random-but-deterministic behavior by using a hash of users’ ids to resolve membership in probabilistic blocks. Briefly, that computation looks like this:</p><pre>hashed_value = <strong>int(</strong>sha1<strong>(</strong>user_id<strong>)</strong>.hexdigest<strong>())<br /></strong>hashed_probability = <strong>(</strong>hashed_value <strong>%</strong> 10000<strong>)</strong> <strong>/</strong> 10000<br /><strong>return</strong> hashed_probability <strong>&lt;</strong> rollout_percentage</pre><p>The method above ensures users always get consistent treatment groups from each Condition Block, without the need to store an explicit mapping between users and treatment groups on a database table or in memory at any time. For completeness, Launch Control does also offer a “Dice” block, which is a truly random determination, although its use cases are relatively rare.</p><p>However, even with a hash-based approach, there is still an additional trap we need to avoid: although the same user should get the same treatment group for <em>a particular</em> Condition Block, we expect users to get different treatment groups for <em>different</em> Condition Blocks. At any time, there may be dozens of different features, all configured as, e.g., 50/50 splits. If we rely on user ids alone for hashing, we would run into users that end up either in <em>all</em> features, or <em>no features at all</em>! Launch Control avoids this by concatenating a per-Condition Block salt to user ids before hashing them. This guarantees each user always gets the same result from a <em>particular</em> Condition Block, while getting potentially different results from <em>different</em> Condition Blocks. When we incorporate a salt into the evaluation, the previous algorithm looks like this:</p><pre>salted_string = f'{condition_block_salt}{user_id}'<br />hashed_value = <strong>int(</strong>sha1<strong>(</strong>salted_string<strong>)</strong>.hexdigest<strong>())<br /></strong>hashed_probability = <strong>(</strong>hashed_value <strong>%</strong> 10000<strong>)</strong> <strong>/</strong> 10000<br /><strong>return</strong> hashed_probability <strong>&lt;</strong> rollout_percentage</pre><p>The targeting engine described above is only one component of Launch Control. We also provide performant, easy-to-use APIs for engineers to query experiments across our tech. stack, in our application backend as well as our React frontend and native Android and iOS clients.</p><p><strong>Backend vs. Frontend Launch Control APIs</strong></p><p>Nextdoor engineers query Launch Control experiments in many places in our codebase: in our backend as we serve web requests to our clients, as well as in our desktop and mobile-web front ends, and finally in our native Android and iOS applications. In all cases, we provide APIs with two specific goals in mind: ease of use and fast, reliable performance. It is imperative that evaluating an experiment take no more than a few hundred microseconds, as complex user features like our main feed requires dozens of individual flags and experiments to render.</p><p>Launch Control experiments are stored internally as <a href="https://engblog.nextdoor.com/sitevars%C2%B9-at-nextdoor-how-engineers-quickly-push-configuration-changes-in-production-d40fd4f6ba5d">Nextdoor Sitevars</a>. Because of this, our backend containers automatically have access to cached, in-host payloads for all relevant experiment definitions. This makes it relatively easy to have the backend Launch Control APIs be performant. Evaluation typically involves a small amount of CPU operations, and thanks to the Sitevars cache, requires no RPCs or network calls. Even despite this, however, Launch Control also maintains a per-web request cache of evaluated experiments, ensuring that each experiment is evaluated at most once, per user and per request.</p><p>On the other hand, the frontend and mobile APIs present more of a challenge. Since this code runs far from our servers, it’s impractical to cache and constantly synchronize all experiment definitions. It would also be prohibitively expensive to make each individual experiment API call involve a network operation. Because of this, we provide two flavors of Launch Control APIs on our clients.</p><p>The most commonly used flavor is a <em>local</em> API, which relies on the client having a known, pre-fetched list of experiments available in memory at all times. Clients run a single network request which fetches all experiment evaluations in this list at key application lifecycle moments (such as user login, session refresh, etc.), and those results are then available for code to query against in a synchronous fashion. We also provide an <em>asynchronous</em> API, which does allow engineers to make individual network requests for each experiment. This API only exposes non-blocking components, however (such as <a href="https://reactivex.io/documentation/observable.html">Observables</a> on Android and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">Promises</a> on web), to make its asynchronous nature clear and self-enforcing. While the local API is used for the most common experiments users are exposed to, the asynchronous flavor helps prevent rarer use experiments from excessively bloating the prefetch list. Finally, while it is out of scope for this article, Launch Control also provides specific APIs for engineers to run experiments in special cases, such as login and sign up screens, where we do not yet have a particular user available.</p><p><strong>Other Features</strong></p><p>The most important components of Launch Control are its targeting algorithms and query APIs, as described above. However, it also has a number of convenience and ease-of-use features, designed to make experimentation and feature flagging at Nextdoor a delightful experience. We strongly believe that engineers deserve tools that are as good as the products we ship to our neighbors around the world. Some of the other important Launch Control features include:</p><ul><li><strong>Contextual editing UI:</strong> The UI for each Condition Block type is unique and has deep knowledge of that block’s context. For example, allow-lists for individual users expose a generic search and typeahead. This allows us to add users by their name, email, or other traits, eliminating the need for people to memorize ids, and empowering team XFN partners such as Product Managers and Designers to add themselves to experiments directly.</li><li><strong>Versioning and fast reverts:</strong> Launch Control experiments are stored internally as Nextdoor Sitevars, which have built-in support for versioning. Whenever a Launch Control is updated, we store a new version of it, with useful metadata such as edit time and author. This allows us to easily navigate through the full history of an experiment, eliminating the need to maintain redundant documentation on when a particular rollout changed. In addition, storing every version of an experiment also allows us to quickly revert features to known-good states in case anything goes unexpectedly sideways with a release.</li><li><strong>Built-in observability and update subscriptions:</strong> Every Launch Control automatically publishes useful real time statistics whenever it’s evaluated, for all users. This allows teams to verify, in real time, that their experiments are going out to the expected number of users, and in the right proportions. In addition, employees can also subscribe to Launch Control experiments, so they get automatically notified when an experiment is updated.</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Launch Control experiments drive many of our recent Nextdoor product improvements, such as changes to <a href="https://engblog.nextdoor.com/nextdoor-notifications-how-we-use-ml-to-keep-neighbors-informed-57d8f707aab0">Notifications</a>, <a href="https://engblog.nextdoor.com/modernizing-our-search-stack-6a56ab87db4e">Search</a>, and our <a href="https://engblog.nextdoor.com/metablocks-our-journey-to-an-agglomerated-navigation-logic-beb6a2afcaa3">Business Experience</a>.

        <h2>Learn DevOps by Doing</h2>
        </a>
            
            <p><span class="company">Nextdoor Engineering - Medium</span>: <h4>A tricky problem and what you can learn from it</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3uSv_qTEc7tpi1W1ikEwRg.jpeg" /></figure><p>Nextdoor’s cloud engineering team moves fast and sometimes it means solving or working around quirky and, often undocumented, problems in vendor services and open source tools. This blog post walks through one of those problems we recently encountered in our infrastructure. While the problem is rather niche, I thought this exercise might be interesting for readers who are less familiar with the problem space, those who might be new to the field of DevOps and are looking to chip away at the question of “<em>what do DevOps engineers do?</em>” In an effort to answer part of this question, I wanted to share a problem we recently came across with validating users in our service mesh. For new readers, the setup to the problem is fairly technical but the crux of it and the solution is actually straight-forward. I hope this account won’t scare you but rather make you excited about diving into problems by keeping the following in mind:</p><blockquote>There’s nothing that you can not learn that can not be learned. There is nothing you can not do that can not be done.</blockquote><h3>Setup and Overall Goal</h3><p>My co-worker came to me with an interesting problem. He set up an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) and wanted to use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/listener-authenticate-users.html">user authentication feature</a>. This works by the load balancer sending the user through an authentication flow with an identity provider, like Okta or OneLogin, and retrieving information about that user from the identity provider after they have logged in. The information looks something like this:</p><pre>{<br />  &quot;sub&quot;: &quot;1234567890&quot;,<br />  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Slava&quot;,<br />  &quot;email&quot;: &quot;slava@example.com&quot;,<br />  ...<br />}</pre><p>The load balancer then creates a cryptographic signature of this information along with information on which encryption key and hashing algorithm were used during the signing process. This is then stored in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/listener-authenticate-users.html#user-claims-encoding"><em>x-amzn-oidc-data</em></a> HTTP request header which gets forwarded along with the original HTTP request from the user to the web application.</p><p>Stepping back for a moment, this authentication flow typically happens in web applications. However, by setting up our infrastructure such that this happens earlier on in the request flow we can standardize the authentication processes and simplify lives of application developers. Anecdotally, this sort of standardization to benefit all developers is a major cornerstone of successful DevOps teams.</p><h4>The Environment</h4><p>As I mentioned, the <em>x-amzn-oidc-data</em> token is typically verified by the downstream application itself but there are reasons to additionally perform the verification earlier on such as layered security, auditing, logging, and routing.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*9Mm3_BeDByzSpr5c" /><figcaption>Basic network topology</figcaption></figure><p>In our environment, after the request gets processed by the load balancer it enters our Kubernetes service mesh before being routed to its final destination, a web application. A <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/microservices/what-is-a-service-mesh">service mesh</a> is an intelligent part of the network infrastructure which dynamically routes requests based on a number of factors to applications. There are a handful of different mesh options available for Kubernetes; our team chose to deploy Istio which is built upon<a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/"> Envoy</a>. Envoy is a powerful proxying tool initially developed at Lyft and subsequently adopted by the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/about/who-we-are/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>. While at its core Envoy is written in C++, it also allows developers to write scripts in<a href="https://www.lua.org/about.html"> Lua</a> to process HTTP requests.</p><h4>The Data</h4><p>The information in the <em>x-amzn-oidc-data</em> header is written in the <a href="https://jwt.io/introduction">JSON Web Token</a> (JWT) format. The JWT format simply defines how to encode the information about the signer, the user, and the signature itself. The pseudo code looks like:</p><pre>header = {<br />  &quot;alg&quot;: &quot;ES256&quot;,<br />  &quot;typ&quot;: &quot;JWT&quot;,<br />  &quot;kid&quot;: &quot;1234&quot;,<br />  &quot;signer&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:1234567890:loadbalancer/app/foobar&quot;<br />}</pre><pre>claims = {<br />  &quot;sub&quot;: &quot;1234567890&quot;,<br />  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Slava&quot;,<br />  &quot;email&quot;: &quot;slava@example.com&quot;<br />}</pre><pre># 1. Encoder claims and header<br />header_enc = base64.encode(header)<br />claims_enc = base64.encode(claims)</pre><pre># 2. Concatenate them together with a period<br />payload = header_enc + '.' + claims_enc</pre><pre># 3. Sign and encode signature<br />sig = crypto.sign(payload, private_key, method=&quot;ES256&quot;)<br />sig_enc = base64.url_encode(sig)</pre><pre># 4. Concatenate signature with the data to form the JWT<br />jwt = payload + '.' + sig_enc</pre><p>In order to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm#Signature_verification_algorithm">verify</a> the JWT the application receiving the request needs to go off and lookup the public part of the signing key by its <em>kid</em> (key id) from an endpoint which stores the signing key. Typically, the endpoint to retrieve the key follows the JSON Web Key Set (JWKs) api specification but AWS chose a different approach for making the signing keys available.</p><p>While Envoy already has support for verifying JWT tokens, it only supports the JWKs standard endpoint for retrieving public keys and unfortunately AWS’s endpoint is non-conformant. Luckily with Envoy’s extensibility, we can implement the key fetching and verification ourselves in Lua.</p><h3>A positive attitude</h3><p>By the time I got involved my co-worker had already come up with some Lua code to extract the claim headers, fetch the signing key from an AWS endpoint, and call a signature verification method to verify the claims were signed by the ALB. The only problem was that signature verification kept on failing in a non-obvious manner. Up to this point, my knowledge of JWTs was limited but I had a can-do attitude.</p><p>Solving the signature verification problem proved to be quite challenging. Fairly early on my co-workers identified that the Lua language might not be sufficient enough to solve the problem. This led me down a rabbit hole of writing a signature verification <a href="https://github.com/proxy-wasm/spec/blob/master/docs/WebAssembly-in-Envoy.md">extension</a> for Envoy in TinyGo and subsequently in Typescript after my initial attempt failed. Unfortunately both attempts were thwarted due to subtle limitations in the languages and runtime. However, there was another way and this post will go into the details.</p><p>One might be misled by the brevity of what I’m about to discuss but getting to this point entailed a lot of frustration and dead ends. While grit is the most important aspect of an engineer’s toolkit so is knowing when to quit. Quite honestly, I was about to give up on this problem and spend my time on a more fruitful endeavor but I caught a lucky break by revisiting a prior step with some newfound knowledge from along the way.</p><h4>Where I started</h4><p>Let’s rewind all the way to the beginning. I initially began this journey by reading the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/listener-authenticate-users.html">ALB documentation</a> to see if there was something simple we had missed. While there was nothing obvious, the docs did contain a snippet of Python for performing the verification. This was not super interesting in and of itself because it simply called Python’s JWT library to do the signature verification but it was a starting point since the example did work.</p><p>The example looked like:</p><pre>import jwt, requests, base64, json</pre><pre># Step 1: Get the key id from JWT headers (the kid field)<br />encoded_jwt = headers.dict['x-amzn-oidc-data']<br />jwt_headers = encoded_jwt.split('.')[0]<br />decoded_jwt_headers = base64.b64decode(jwt_headers)<br />decoded_jwt_headers = decoded_jwt_headers.decode(&quot;utf-8&quot;)<br />decoded_json = json.loads(decoded_jwt_headers)<br />kid = decoded_json['kid']</pre><pre># Step 2: Get the public key from regional endpoint<br />url = 'https://public-keys.auth.elb.' + region + '.amazonaws.com/' + kid<br />req = requests.get(url)<br />pub_key = req.text</pre><pre># Step 3: Get the payloadpayload = jwt.decode(encoded_jwt, pub_key, algorithms=['ES256'])</pre><p>Stepping through this example with a Python debugger and going down the call tree step by step provided a clue as to what was missing from the validation happening in Envoy/Lua.</p><h4>The signature</h4><p>To sign the JWT token the ALB requires three pieces of information 1) the data being signed 2) the private key and 3) a hash function. Per the documentation the ALB uses what is known as ES256 or ECDSA key + SHA256 hash function. The output of this signing function is two 256-bit integers referred to as <em>R</em> and <em>S</em>. The two integers are concatenated together forming 64 bytes which represents the full signature.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/904/0*tRjTLR7V2yiNroHI" /><figcaption>Illustrates that R and S are two 256 bit integers</figcaption></figure><p>When doing the verification we feed the verification function the data, public key, hash function, and signature (<em>R</em> + <em>S</em>). The verification function will tell us if the data was in fact signed by the public key’s corresponding private key, thus establishing the trust relationship.</p><p>I noticed when stepping through with a Python debugger that before the 64-byte signature was fed into the verification function, it was being split back into R and S and the two were converted into integers before being encoded into a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6979#section-2.4">DER encoded</a> <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6025">ASN.1</a> structure. ASN.1 is simply an encoding format dating back to 1984 which remains popular in cryptographic applications like OpenSSL. The discovery of the splitting, converting to integers, and encoding seemed “interesting”.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*1V8OTx2kk2dpUlsD" /><figcaption>Stepping through into jwt/utils.py and its use of encode_dss_signature</figcaption></figure><p>Knowing the signature may need to be encoded gave a hint as to why it wasn’t working in our Lua script. A quick read of the Envoy docs and following the source code showed the verification function in Envoy’s Lua was actually backed by a C++ helper function. The helper function calls the<a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/EVP_DigestVerify.html"> EVP_DigestVerify</a> function in OpenSSL which performs the validation. While documentation for this function is rather scant, googling around for usages of it in other projects showed that the signature was being encoded beforehand.</p><h3>Finding a solution</h3><p>At this point the obvious problem of why the signature verification was failing was solved. The less obvious and trickier problem was how do we encode the signature before passing it to the verification function. This finally brings us to the crux of this fun little problem.</p><h4>Comparing outputs</h4><p><em>How does one encode ASN.1 in Lua?</em> The obvious answer is you turn to GitHub and find a library someone already wrote, something like this <a href="https://github.com/nmap/nmap/blob/master/nselib/asn1.lua">one from NMAP</a>. But what if that doesn’t work? It initially didn’t work because the library was written for a newer version of Lua than what Envoy supported. After some modifications to replace new language function calls with older ones I got the encoder running but it was producing the wrong output. I knew this because I had the output from the encoder running in Python and was able to compare the two.</p><pre>[slava]$ <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/hexdump.1.html">hexdump</a> lua_output.bin<br />0000000 <strong>30</strong> 0c <strong>02 04 71 6d fb 33</strong> 02 04 <strong>ce 83 66 58<br /></strong>000000e</pre><pre>[slava]$ hexdump python_output.bin<br />0000000 <strong>30</strong> 45 <strong>02 20 71 6d fb 33</strong> 00 91 74 3e a8 92 ce 3c<br />0000010 e0 7c 30 cf b8 5d 08 62 5d 82 c1 31 a5 95 93 11<br />0000020 d1 77 bc 81 <strong>02</strong> 21 00 <strong>ce 83 66 58</strong> a5 11 57 23 30<br />0000030 59 0f 80 3e f3 a9 ae 25 9a d5 ed 20 84 50 57 94<br />0000040 52 6c 92 6e 2b 99 2c<br />0000047</pre><p>At a first glance those two outputs don’t look similar at all but on a closer inspection they do have some similarities which I’ve marked in bold. Somehow only part of <em>R</em> and <em>S</em> are being encoded. A good guess would be that there’s truncation happening here.</p><p>As it turned out, unpacking an integer represented by a 256-bit array into an integer primitive in Lua simply wasn’t going to work in a language that primarily dealt with 32-bits. This is the point where I almost gave up because going off and writing an unpacking library that made use of bigint under the hood and somehow tying that into the ASN.1 encoder was more work than I wanted to do at that point.</p><h4>Noticing a pattern</h4><p>Then I saw a commonality. What if I could take a shortcut? While I was playing around with the <a href="https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/utils/#cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.utils.encode_dss_signature">encode_dss_signature</a> function in Python I started to notice a pattern.</p><pre># Bit of python that encodes R and S into ASN.1 and then writes the<br /># signature into a file.</pre><pre>from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.utils import encode_dss_signature</pre><pre>r = 42<br />s = 63</pre><pre>sig = encode_dss_signature(r, s)</pre><pre>f = open(f'/tmp/{r}_{s}.bin', 'wb')<br />f.write(sig)<br />f.close()</pre><p>Using the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/hexdump.1.html">hexdump</a> cli tool we can print the encoded binary files out in hex format.</p><pre># r = 42  hex value: 2a<br /># s = 63  hex value: 3f</pre><pre>[slava]$ hexdump 42_63.bin<br />0000000 <strong>30 06 02</strong> <strong>01</strong> 2a <strong>02</strong> <strong>01</strong> 3f</pre><pre># r = 12   hex value: 0c<br /># s = 127  hex value: 7f</pre><pre>[slava]$ hexdump 12_127.bin<br />0000000 <strong>30 06 02</strong> <strong>01</strong> 0c <strong>02</strong> <strong>01</strong> 7f</pre><pre># r = 4277071598   hex value: feeeeeee<br /># s = 4294967295   hex value: ffffffff</pre><pre>[slava]$ hexdump bignums.bin<br />0000000 <strong>30 0e 02 05 </strong>00 fe ee ee ee <strong>02 05</strong> 00 ff ff ff ff</pre><p>The pattern was that the bytes of <em>R</em> and <em>S</em> were directly sandwiched between some bytes that typically were the same except when <em>R</em> and <em>S</em> grew in <em>bignums.bin</em>. A thought popped into my head, I don’t actually need to convert the two into integers if the ASN.1 encoder is simply turning the integer value back into a series of bytes.</p><h4>Making sense of the pattern</h4><p>I found the <a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/openssl-asn1parse.html">openssl asn1parse</a> command as part of the openssl cli tool which provided structural information about the encoded signature file.</p><pre>[slava]$ openssl asn1parse -in 42_63.bin -inform der -i<br />   0:d=0  hl=2 l=   6 cons: SEQUENCE<br />   2:d=1  hl=2 l=   1 prim:  INTEGER           :2A<br />   5:d=1  hl=2 l=   1 prim:  INTEGER           :3F</pre><p>The key thing to note from the above command output is the file has a structure to it. Specifically there are references to <em>SEQUENCE</em> and <em>INTEGER</em>. This makes sense since we encoded two integers. The sequence must be referring to essentially a list of things of which we have two integers.</p><p>I typically look at the official <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments">Request For Comments</a> docs detailing this sort of thing but in this case I had some trouble understanding the encoding scheme as detailed in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6025#section-2.1.2">rfc6025</a>. After a bit of Googling I found the following table that helped explain what I was seeing in the <em>hexdump</em> output in relation to the output from <em>asn1parse</em>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/510/0*I8_T99K9EZ8uBrNO" /><figcaption><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/a-warm-welcome-to-asn1-and-der/#tag">https://letsencrypt.org/docs/a-warm-welcome-to-asn1-and-der/#tag</a></figcaption></figure><p>A <em>SEQUENCE</em> is defined by the hex value of 30 and <em>INTEGER</em> by hex value 02 . Piecing it together we can decipher the hexdump of<em> R = 42 (2a)</em> and<em> S = 63 (3f)</em> .</p><pre># r = 42  hex value: 2a<br /># s = 63  hex value: 3f</pre><pre>[slava]$ hexdump 42_63.bin<br /><strong>30</strong> <strong>06</strong> 02 01 2a 02 01 3f<br />^^ ^^<br />|<br />|+- Sequence (<strong>30</strong>) of length 6 (<strong>06</strong>) bytes</pre><pre>30 06 <strong>02</strong> <strong>01</strong> <strong>2a</strong> 02 01 3f<br />      ^^ ^^ ^^<br />      |+- Integer (<strong>02</strong>) of length 1 (<strong>01</strong>) byte with value <strong>2a</strong></pre><pre>30 06 02 01 2a <strong>02 01 3f<br />               </strong>^^ ^^ ^^<br />               |+- Integer (<strong>02</strong>) of length 1 (<strong>01</strong>) byte of value <strong>3f</strong></pre><h4>Finding a solution</h4><p>From here, we can compose an ASN.1 DER signature fairly easily since we have <em>R</em> and <em>S</em> along with their lengths. I’ve included an example solution on GitHub along with a working Envoy configuration to see this in action.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/stlava/envoy-asn1-example">GitHub - stlava/envoy-asn1-example</a></p><h3>A look back</h3><p>This was quite the adventure from where we began with the initial problem statement of wanting to use a load balancer to do user authentication and verifying requests in the service mesh. For me it involved reading mounds of documentation and technical blog posts like this one. As a result, I now know a whole lot more about Lua, ASN.1 and JsonWeb Tokens and I also dove into web assembly with TinyGo and TypeScript. Every day isn’t like this, but this little adventure is representative of the broad domain an engineer may work through in a role on this team.</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>In closing, I want to touch upon a few parting thoughts for new readers. Operations is an ever evolving field with team titles like SRE, DevOps, DevSecOps, Cloud Engineers, and others people keep inventing. An engineer on one of those teams may be working on completely different tasks than their counterpart at a different company.</p><p>A successful DevOps engineer may not be a subject matter expert like their peers on other teams but they nonetheless possess a powerful toolkit. Simply reflecting on this adventure I’d include the following:</p><ol><li>The ability to find and synthesize documentation and code in software they are not familiar with.</li><li>Being comfortable reading code in languages they do not practice.</li><li>The tenacity to walk into a problem space with a positive attitude.</li></ol><p>This list is by no means comprehensive and all of these skills are built up over time. However, for new readers just entering the field the most important thing is a willingness and commitment to learn and answer the question of: “<em>How does something work as you peel back the layers?</em>”</p><p>Don’t be afraid to ask and seek answers for questions like: <em>“</em><a href="https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when"><em>what happens when I type google.com in my address bar and hit enter?</em></a><em>”</em> or <em>“</em><a href="https://github.com/0xAX/linux-insides/blob/master/Booting/linux-bootstrap-1.md"><em>how does my computer boot up</em></a><em>?”</em></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Some readers may look at this list and say these are traits of any successful engineer and while I agree with you, I would also argue DevOps and DevOps adjacent engineers need to walk into unfamiliar problems in foreign pieces of code day in and day out.</p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=d1e02712d40c" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://engblog.nextdoor.com/learn-devops-by-doing-d1e02712d40c">Learn DevOps by Doing</a> was originally published in <a href="https://engblog.nextdoor.com">Nextdoor Engineering</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p></p>

        <h2>Engineering Principles (v1) at Nextdoor</h2>
        </a>
            
            <p><span class="company">Nextdoor Engineering - Medium</span>: <p>At Nextdoor, the written version of these engineering principles is new; however, the principles themselves are not. These principles developed from within Nextdoor’s values, our purpose, how we’ve worked together over these last several years. Our goal in sharing these with the broader engineering community is so we can help learn from one another.</p><p>Engineers are constantly faced with weighing the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches and in many ways, it’s the art of making constant tradeoffs. Similar to other engineering organizations, Nextdoor has a set of unwritten rules on how to evaluate tradeoffs and to make strategic decisions. These principles were effectively embedded in the engineering culture and they spread verbally amongst our engineers over time.</p><p>As we rapidly scale Nextdoor’s engineering organization, we quickly realized it is important to explicitly write out these principles rather than leaving them unspoken. Moreover, unwritten rules cannot scale for a growing engineering organization distributed across multiple locations. Written rules are also more equitable as everyone has equal access to them. We want all new engineers to learn and apply our engineering principles quickly.</p><p>The goal for our new engineering principles is threefold. First, we want to create a shared vocabulary for how we weigh tradeoffs. Second, we wanted these principles to help us make consistent decisions all throughout the organization. Third, we wanted to create a shared understanding of the rules of engagement for how engineers and teams should interact with each other.</p><p>These principles are not meant to be dogmatic but rather to bias us towards a particular way of thinking. When engineers weigh the pros and cons of an approach, we think of these as a finger on the scale guiding us in a certain direction. Applying the principles requires exercising good judgment. In some cases, the principles may even be in tension with each other.</p><p>This post is very long, and that’s by design. As a company, Nextdoor has a small number of core values. We also have guiding principles that help us make day-to-day decisions. Each principle contains the description and also the rationale behind the principle. The reason for this is that these principles are often nuanced and we don’t want them being mindlessly applied as if they are hard-and-fast rules. It’s important to understand the intention behind the principle to know when and when not to apply it. In some cases, we explicitly call out the “limiting principle” to help us avoid over-indexing on these principles.</p><p>And if you are interested in building active local communities and are interested in our engineering principles, please reach out. We have multiple opportunities across all technical areas at Nextdoor. Please check our <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/embed/job_board?for=nextdoor&amp;b=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.nextdoor.com%2Fcareers%2F#51115">Careers Page</a> out for a detailed list of all the roles currently open and let’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoniosilveira1/">connect on Linkedin</a>.</p><h3>Engineering Principles at Nextdoor</h3><ul><li>Purpose-Driven not Tech Driven</li><li>Software Engineering is a Team Sport</li><li>Empowering Engineers</li><li>Moving Fast</li><li>Collective Code Ownership</li><li>Optimize for Learning</li><li>Craftsmanship</li></ul><h3>Purpose-Driven not Tech Driven</h3><p>We’re a purpose-driven company. We never build technology for the sake of technology. We build technology to deliver value to the neighbors and organizations we serve. We build great infrastructure to enable our engineers to move faster. We use data and insights to understand how our changes impact our customers.</p><h3>⭑ Recognize impact over shipping</h3><p>In general, we bias towards recognizing sustainable impact over shipping. Impact is defined as delivering value to our neighborhoods and our customers (both internal and external). We strive not to “confuse movement with progress.” We strive to measure our impact with data when possible.</p><p><em>Why is this important? </em>We want to align our engineers’ incentives with the company’s purpose.</p><p><em>Limiting Principle?</em> Not every project we try will succeed. We will likely fail as much as we succeed. We never stigmatize failure, but we do expect that over the long term, the impact of our successes will outweigh the costs of our failures. See Optimize for Learning below. In addition, at the more junior engineering levels, we do recognize and reward execution. Also, not every impactful change can be measured so sometimes the impact will be based on conviction, alignment with our product strategy, company values, and qualitative feedback.</p><p>When evaluating impact, we should always think about it as the impact-over-time summation (i.e. the integral under the curve). We don’t want to create a culture that rewards an engineer with achieving a modest short-term improvement at the expense of a large amount of tech debt that dramatically slows down future productivity. We should consider the impact holistically and take into account the short-term improvements with the long-term costs. This is heavily tied into our company value of “Act Like an Owner” as an owner should always be considering value over a long-term time horizon.</p><h3>⭑ Value over originality</h3><p>We shouldn’t strive to be original for the sake of being original. Being different is not a goal. Being original is valuable when it’s in service of our purpose. In fact, much of what exists in our Engineering Principles is taken from the learnings of other companies.</p><p><em>Corollary.</em> We don’t build when we can buy something or use open-source that meets our needs and building it doesn’t differentiate Nextdoor or the experience.</p><p><em>Limiting Principle?</em> We shouldn’t blindly copy other technical and product decisions from other companies. We should always evaluate decisions in terms of Nextdoor’s purpose and values. We should understand that a decision made at a certain point of time does not necessarily mean it’s the right decision today.</p><h3>⭑ Reward the foundational work</h3><p>We celebrate and reward the foundational work that is critical to delivering value to our neighborhoods and to our customers. This work is equally as important and necessary as feature work. By foundational work, we mean all the work that goes into supporting a fast and polished product. This includes areas that provide leverage such as Infrastructure, Developer Experience, Platform APIs, and Tools. It also includes the work to maintain a clean codebase that we take pride in. It also includes the craftsmanship that goes into building a polished product that delivers delight to our neighborhoods.</p><p><em>Why is this important?</em> Every type of work is important when it’s in service of our purpose. Fixing tech debt, supporting legacy systems, doing large painful refactorings, writing SQL queries to analyze an experiment are examples of this important work that we should all take on. Senior engineers should be models of this behavior. We should never think of a certain type of work as being dirty or unglamorous when it’s in service of our purpose.</p><h3>⭑ Pragmatism over Dogmatism</h3><p>As engineers, we are constantly faced with weighing tradeoffs and making recommendations and decisions. We hold opinions loosely in order to make pragmatic decisions based on known requirements. When conditions change, we let go of previously-held opinions. We bias towards making choices based on weighing the costs and benefits.</p><p><em>Limiting Principle? </em>We don’t compromise on our company’s core values and we have created a set of guiding principles in this document to help us guide our behavior and decision-making process. That said, most decisions are rarely all or nothing and we are often tasked with evaluating tradeoffs when our principles or even core values may be in tension with each other.</p><h3>⭑ Globally Optimize</h3><p>We strive to make decisions that adhere to “What’s in Nextdoor’s best interest?” We are system-level thinkers and we take into account how our changes impact other teams in engineering, the entire company, our neighborhoods, and our customers.</p><p><em>Why is this important? </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway’s Law</a> states that <em>“Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure.”</em> By keeping this top of mind, we can resist shipping our org chart when it’s not serving our purpose.</p><h3>Software Engineering is a Team Sport</h3><p>We build software as teams, not as individuals. It’s essential that we are able to collaborate well with each other in order to reach the best outcomes.</p><h3>⭑ We treat each other with respect</h3><p>We are members of a community and it is essential that we treat each other with respect. We’re invested in one another’s success and this means we listen to each other and help each other to succeed. We understand that work is just one part of people’s lives and we seek to understand people in their entirety and withhold judgment.</p><p><em>Why is this important?</em> Each engineer brings their unique superpowers, perspectives, and background to the table. We are only able to do our best work and harness our unique abilities when we treat each other with respect.</p><h3>⭑ Optimism over Pessimism. Avoid cynicism.</h3><p>We approach our work and our coworkers with positivity. We like the improv rule of “Yes and” instead of our initial instinct being “No” since starting with “No” tends to stifle creativity. We want to aim to assist the person.</p><p><em>Why is this important?</em> Pessimism and cynicism are contagious and drain energy and creativity. A single pessimistic or cynical person can destroy the productivity of an entire team (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237683988_How_When_and_Why_Bad_Apples_Spoil_the_Barrel_Negative_Group_Members_and_Dysfunctional_Groups">study</a>).</p><p><em>Limiting principle?</em> We still must be realistic and provide valid feedback. There’s always a way to provide honest feedback while still remaining positive. We also don’t want to create cases where one engineer is blocking another engineer and the onus is solely on the blocker to unblock the work. It’s a shared responsibility to try to get to “Yes”.</p><h3>⭑ Clean escalations when there are disagreements</h3><p>When we disagree, each side should strive to understand the other side. When both sides can articulate the other’s point of view, they are able to distill the disagreement down to its essence. A clean escalation is one where both parties bring the disagreement to a third party in order to help mediate or arbitrate the decision. A dirty escalation is where one party escalates to the third party without the other. There should be a willingness to disagree and commit when a consensus can’t be reached.</p><p><em>Why is this important? </em>Many disagreements are not actually disagreements but rather the two sides talking past each other or failing to understand the other’s point of view. When the parties truly understand each other’s point of view, there often doesn’t need to be an escalation. If an escalation is required, it’s more efficient when the disagreement has been distilled down to its essence.</p><h3>Empowering Engineers</h3><p>We hire talented people and empower them to accomplish our purpose. Engineering should be rewarding and building should be a creative process. Easy things should be easy and hard things should be in service of the actual business problems versus fighting with the infrastructure or tools.</p><h3>⭑ Context over control</h3><p>We believe in providing engineers and engineering teams with the context they need to make sound decisions as opposed to being order takers. We want engineers to operate with autonomy as part of their cross-functional teams while taking into account the needs of their stakeholders. It’s the obligation of leadership to provide the context such as our strategy, our priorities, and our resources so engineers can make sound decisions.</p><p><em>Why is this important? </em>Engineers are problem-solvers that collaborate with their cross-functional partners to build great products for our customers and great infrastructure for other engineers and stakeholders. We want to avoid a permission-seeking culture where engineers feel they need to be told what to do or seek management approval. An engineer at Nextdoor should <em>not</em> function as an API that is called by their Engineering Manager or Product Manager to mindlessly translate tasks and specs into Pull Requests.</p><h3>⭑ Infra &gt; Tools &gt; Docs &gt; Process</h3><p>We prefer solving problems at the infrastructure level to reduce the burden on our engineers and to implement consistency across the company. If we can’t solve it at the infra level, we’d prefer solving it with tooling rather than through documentation or process.</p><p><em>Why is this important? </em>We want our engineers to be able to be as productive as possible. Process can slow engineers down, even when there is the best of intentions. Documentation gets out of date or is undiscoverable. Infra automates the work away and reduces cognitive overhead. Great tooling can often replace manual processes.</p><h3>⭑ Self-service over file a ticket</h3><p>We prefer self-service tools over processes that require human intervention.</p><p><em>Why is this important?</em> Self-service can be instantaneous. It avoids blocking an engineer on another person and reduces context switching. We strive to reduce dependencies and processes that require human intervention. An example is the impersonation permission flow which allows an engineer to obtain temporary permission to impersonate a neighbor without requiring human intervention in a safe and auditable manner.</p><h3>⭑ Transparent Decisions</h3><p>We are transparent with our decisions, explaining the reasons behind our decisions, and the decision-making process itself. We do our best to document and share our decisions, and make meeting notes visible to the entire company when possible. At Nextdoor we use the <a href="https://coda.io/@gokulrajaram/gokuls-spade-toolkit">SPADE</a> framework to document and broadly share important decisions for product, engineering and business topics.</p><h3>Moving Fast</h3><p>We believe that moving fast is essential for us to accomplish our purpose. This is encapsulated in our company core value of “Experiment and learn quickly”. We also recognize that there are tradeoffs between moving fast now versus moving fast over the long term.</p><h3>⭑ Under-engineering is preferable to over-engineering</h3><p>We prefer to validate our product and engineering decisions quickly and add things later that we missed. Therefore, we want to architect our systems taking into account known requirements and build what is truly needed.</p><p><em>Why is this important?</em></p><p>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Gall.27s_law">— Gall’s Law</a></p><p><em>Limiting principle?</em> We should be careful to not box ourselves into a corner with our early decisions but also not to waste resources over-engineering something where we don’t understand the long term requirements.</p><h3>⭑ Working code over comprehensive documentation</h3><p>We prefer to bias towards building and prototyping over writing long architectural docs and blocking on architectural approvals. We agree with the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">Agile Manifesto</a>.</p><p><em>Why is this important? </em>We want to be as agile as possible and learn through experimentation and iteration. A prototype, like a picture, says a thousand words.</p><p><em>Limiting principle?</em> Large changes that impact many engineers often require more up-front design and stakeholder feedback. See Farm for Dissent. We should write overview docs and how-to-docs for infrastructure that is used by many engineers. We are not against documentation. This is a “bias towards” not an “all or nothing” approach.</p><h3>⭑ Build iteratively</h3><p>We prefer to build iteratively such that our changes deliver value incrementally.</p><p><em>Why is this important? </em>We want to avoid multi-quarter projects where no value is delivered until the very end of the project. Industry experience shows that these projects tend to be high risk and often fail. Almost all projects can be broken up into milestones that deliver value iteratively along the way and help validate the direction, build momentum for the team, and avoid trying to hit a moving target where the requirements change over time.</p><p><em>Limiting principle? </em>Larger, strategic projects may take longer to deliver value. To ensure that we are on the right track and making continuous progress, these projects should have milestones that incrementally validate themselves if the value can’t be delivered more iteratively.</p><h3>⭑ Infrastructure Should Be Easy/Secure/Fast By Default</h3><p>Our infrastructure should enable engineers to fall into the “pit of success”. We pick defaults that should lead to the right outcomes. We strive to eliminate foot guns. We strive to minimize writing the same boilerplate code over and over. We optimize the infrastructure to make the lives of the customers better as this is the direction of the leverage. The scope and responsibility of the infrastructure maintainers expand to accomplish this goal. Building on top of our infrastructure should feel like playing with legos. You can’t hurt yourself playing with legos, but you can build something great.</p><p><em>Why is this important? </em>Our engineers are more productive when the infrastructure allows them to focus on the product value rather than solving recurring problems that can be solved once for everybody.</p><h3>⭑ Minimize repositories and services</h3><p>We strive to minimize the number of repositories and services that need to be touched to build an end-to-end product change. We explicitly want to identify having micro-services that provide middle-tier functionality as being an anti-pattern.</p><p><em>Why is this important?</em> We measure our velocity by how quickly we can deliver end-to-end improvements to our customers. Even though having more services can make it faster to merge a single PR, it slows down product development when an end-to-end feature requires merging into multiple repositories, sequencing the deployments, and maintaining protocol compatibility between services. In addition, it’s impossible to factor product functionality correctly from the beginning as products evolve and the requirements change. Refactoring code within a single service is much easier than refactoring the services themselves.</p><p><em>Limiting principle?</em> Good candidates for services are ones where the interface is extremely stable and product changes rarely need to be coordinated across protocol boundaries (e.g. DynamoDB, Redis, Postgres). Separate vertical products that have very little coupling to other products may also be good candidates (e.g. Ads Platform).</p><h3>⭑ Two-way doors are better than one-way doors</h3><p>We prefer decisions that are easy to undo. We optimize for making cheap mistakes, since making mistakes is unavoidable. When considering a one-way door, we should heavily lean on Farm for dissent.</p><p><em>Why is this important? </em>Making mistakes that are easy to undo means we can move faster and learn quickly. One-way doors require a lot of time and energy since the stakes are much higher.</p><h3>⭑ Testability and Testing</h3><p>Our code should be easy to test and well-tested. When building libraries and infrastructure, it’s not enough to write unit tests for the library. The library should be written such that the code that uses it is also easy to test. A library that makes it hard to test the code that uses it is not a very good library.</p><p><em>Why is this important?</em> Unit, integration, and automation tests help us move faster. While it might slow down the initial development to write the tests, in the long run the tests allow us to move faster in the future and avoid costly regressions.</p><p><em>Limiting principle? </em>We are not a test-driven development shop that requires 100% code coverage. Writing and maintaining tests have a cost and a benefit. We should make writing tests as easy as possible. We should have a bias towards writing tests, but we should be pragmatic and weigh tradeoffs.</p><h3>⭑ Observability</h3><p>We should strive to make our services and applications have a high degree of observability. Analytics, logging, error handling and metrics are a critical part of everything we build.</p><p><em>Why is this important?</em> Nextdoor is fundamentally a complicated system. It’s made especially complicated because it’s an ecosystem that has network effects where users affect each other’s behavior. It’s critical that we write our products and services to be as observable as possible so that we know they’re working as expected and so we can quickly perform root cause analysis when something goes wrong. A small amount of work to build observability upfront generally saves countless hours later.</p><h3>Collective Code Ownership</h3><p>Collective code ownership stems from our belief that Software Engineering is a Team Sport and supports our desire to Empower Engineers and to Move Fast. Engineers need to be able to easily read, understand, and modify code written by other engineers.</p><h3>⭑ Stewardship over strict code ownership</h3><p>Our intention is similar to what Martin Fowler describes as <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeOwnership.html">weak code ownership</a>. Engineers should not act defensively when another engineer or team desires to make a change to the code they generally maintain. Instead, they should act as stewards of the code advising other teams on how best to work together to facilitate a change that furthers our purpose. This should be in the context of the ProdDev ownership process where the team owning the area of the product affected should be the approver of the change.</p><p><em>Why is this important? </em>We don’t want our engineers acting territorially. This slows down innovation and makes cross-cutting changes more difficult. We generally want to rely on engineers to exercise good judgment when seeking code reviews rather than requiring strict approvals from code owners. This is enabled by having a safe infrastructure.</p><p><em>Limiting Principle?</em> We expect engineers to exercise good judgment and seek feedback and code reviews from the persons or teams that are best able to review the change. We expect engineers to follow the ProdDev ownership process.</p><h3>⭑ Minimize languages and frameworks</h3><p>We strive to minimize the number of languages and frameworks used at the company.</p><p><em>Why is this important?</em> We want engineers to be able to contribute across the product and at different levels of the stack. This enables engineers to work in more areas of the product, reduces dependencies between teams, and increases agility of the organization. This also reduces silos and allows us to work as one engineering team.</p><p><em>Limiting Principle</em>? Often there are good reasons to introduce a new language or framework. This must be balanced against the long term maintenance cost and complexity introduced to the engineering organization. It should be done with strong intention rather than convenience. Valid reasoning: “We should write the Ad code in Java because Java is the standard language across the broader advertising ecosystem and all the libraries assume Java.” Less valid: “There’s a cool new library in Rust. Let’s write this service in Rust.”</p><h3>⭑ Opinionated conventions</h3><p>We should have conventions that are opinionated and consistent across all of engineering. Our aspiration is that code written by multiple engineers should be indistinguishable in style, patterns, and structure.</p><p><em>Why is this important?</em> We want engineers to easily move between areas of the code base in order to build end-to-end functionality for our customers. Code is easier to read and modify when we have consistent conventions. We can build better infrastructure and tooling around known conventions and best practices.</p><h3>Optimize for Learning</h3><p>We foster a culture of learning that optimizes for exploration, openness, and creativity. We hire employees who are united by our shared curiosity and desire to apply our learnings towards accomplishing our purpose.</p><h3>⭑ Give and receive feedback with good intent</h3><p>We should give and receive feedback with the assumption of good intent. When giving feedback, we should strive to make it constructive, timely, and actionable. When receiving feedback, we should assume the giver is trying to help us improve. We should always acknowledge and be thankful for the feedback. That does not mean the feedback must be accepted. It’s also okay to thoughtfully consider and reject feedback. When a person acts on our feedback, we should close the loop by acknowledging the improvement.</p><p><em>Why is this important?</em> We’re a growth-oriented culture and we learn and improve through feedback. We want engineers to feel comfortable providing feedback because withholding it denies the other person information they may need to grow and results in worse outcomes for the company.</p><p><em>Limiting principle?</em> Feedback is never an excuse to create a culture of “brilliant jerks”. Feedback should never be weaponized. Feedback should only be given when the intent is to help the person improve and the feedback is actionable.</p><h3>⭑ Farm for dissent</h3><p>Engineers should socialize their ideas to seek out diverse perspectives from both inside and outside engineering. The larger the risk and cost of a mistake, the more important it is to seek out feedback. Engineers should exercise good judgment on who are the best people to provide feedback based on the particular domain of the change. Often the best people to consult are in other functions such as Data Science, Marketing, Product, Design, ProdOps, Legal,, etc.,</p><p><em>Why is this important?</em> Everybody has blind spots and we reach better architecture and design decisions when we seek out feedback and diverse perspectives.</p><h3>⭑ Whisper Wins. Sunlight Failure.</h3><p>We should strive to shine as much light on our failures as possible so that the organization can learn from the mistakes. Failure is an inevitable part of the process. We celebrate our wins but we should be humble and avoid building a culture of bragging.</p><p><em>Why is this important?</em> We want to create a culture that thinks big and takes risks. Many things we try will fail and we want to learn from failure. We should never stigmatize failing.</p><h3>⭑ Retrospective Culture and SEVs</h3><p>Processes like retrospectives and <a href="https://response.pagerduty.com/before/severity_levels/">SEVs</a> (Site EVents) are for learning, never for blaming. We learn from our outages and our mistakes and make improvements to our infrastructure and tooling to try to prevent similar issues in the future.</p><p><em>Why is this important?</em></p><p><em>“If you’re not making mistakes, then you’re not doing anything. I’m positive that a doer makes mistakes.”</em> -John Wooden</p><h3>Craftsmanship</h3><p>Craftsmanship is generally defined as skill in building something that is of high quality where great attention was paid to the details and no corners were cut. This is an aspirational goal and it’s often in tension with many of our other principles (e.g. Moving Fast).</p><p>At Nextdoor, we do not adopt a pure craftsmanship approach as that would almost certainly mean we were prioritizing perfection over-delivering value, and moving fast. Instead, we should always understand what a well-crafted solution looks like. When we compromise, it should never be because we were lazy or sloppy. Rather, it should always be due to a tradeoff that was made in service of our purpose. We should take great pride in what we build. A compromise that is made for the right reason can still be a point of pride.</p><p>Let us know in the comments what are the principles that resonated with you and if you have examples or other engineering principles that you apply within your teams.

        <h2>Five things I learned about working on content quality at Instagram</h2>
        </a>
            
            <p><span class="company">Instagram Engineering - Medium</span>: <h3>Introduction</h3><p>Recommended content, which is surfaced in places like Explore or hashtags, is a central part of people’s experience on Instagram. As people browse this “unconnected content” from accounts that they aren’t already linked to on Instagram, it’s extremely important to identify and deal with content that violates our Community Guidelines or might be considered offensive or inappropriate by the viewer. Last year, we formed a team dedicated to finding and taking action on both violating and potentially offensive content on these unconnected surfaces of Instagram, as part of our ongoing effort to help keep our community safe.<br /> <br />This work differs from conventional platform work. Platform teams at Facebook traditionally focus on solving a problem across a number of surfaces, such as News Feed and Stories. However, Explore and Hashtags are particularly complicated ecosystems. We chose to create a bespoke solution that builds on the work of our platform teams, and apply it to these complex surfaces.<br /> <br />Now, a year later, we are sharing the lessons we learned from this effort. These changes are essential in our ongoing commitment to keep people safe on Instagram, and we hope they can also help shape the strategies of other teams thinking about how to improve the quality of content across their products.</p><h3>Learning 1: Measuring quality is difficult. Operationalizing your measurement on experimentation is critical for your team’s success.</h3><p>One of the toughest challenges this year has been identifying how to accurately measure the quality of content. There’s no industry benchmark when it comes to measuring quality in a deterministic way.<br /> <br />In addition, when measuring the quality of experiments and A/B tests from multiple engineering teams, trying to hand-label each test group subset from our experiments proved to be time intensive and unlikely to produce statistically significant results. Overall, this was not a scalable solution.<br /> <br />We transitioned across many different types of metrics: from using deterministic user signals to rating both test and control groups for all experiments. This transition of metrics over experimentation took significant effort and led us to spend many iteration cycles understanding the results of our experiments.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*M_vyOynSyXIXtH4V8kVMGg.png" /><figcaption>Trying to manually label every experiment was simply not scalable. We often saw results like the above: huge overlapping confidence intervals and no directionality intuition of your experiment.</figcaption></figure><p>In the end, we decided to combine manual labels for calibration and software-generated scores together, to get the best of both worlds. By relying on both human labels for calibration and a classifier, we were able to scale the calibrated classifier score (in other words, the probability of a content violation at a given score) to the entire experiment. This allowed us to achieve more statistically significant approximation of impact when compared to either human labels and classifiers alone. <br /> <br /><strong>Conclusion: Don’t try to solve quality without operationalizing your metrics, and make sure your engineers have a reliable online metric they can reference in their experiments. Also, when thinking about quality, think about how you can rely on classifier scores and manually-labelled data to approximate the directionality and magnitude of your launches.</strong></p><h3>Learning 2: Read-path quality models can be more precise and reliable when thinking about enforcement at the ranking level.</h3><p>Historically, we have always used classifiers that would predict whether a piece of content is good or bad at upload time, which we call “write-path classifiers.” Having a write-path classifier has the advantage of being efficient, but it has a major drawback: it can only look at the content itself (i.e. pixels and captions). It cannot incorporate real-time features, those which can provide a lot of insight into whether a piece of media is good or bad, such as comments or other engagement signals.<br /> <br />Last year, we started working on a “read-path model”. This “read path model” is an impression-level real-time classifier for detecting unwanted content (photos, videos), combining both the upload time signals and the real-time engagement signals at media and author level. This particular model, therefore, would run every time a user makes a request to see a page on Explore, scoring each candidate in real time at the request level.<br /> <br />This model turned out to be extremely successful. By using real time engagement signals in combination with the content features, it was capable of capturing and understanding bad behaviors associated with violating content.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/929/1*cOAMgETMMQbs7Sps0kGX_w.png" /><figcaption>Our initial proposal with the Well-being team on using both write-path and read-path models ended up being extremely effective at reducing unwanted content on Explore.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Conclusion: if you are considering applying quality signals into your ranking model, using a read-path model trained with both content-level and engagement-level features can be a more reliable and precise means of achieving better results.</strong></p><h3>Learning 3: Although read-path models are important, you must also have sourcing-level filters.</h3><p>While we know read-path models are important in filtering violating and potentially inappropriate content from unconnected surfaces at ranking level<strong>, </strong>we found that<strong> </strong>having a basic level of protection at the sourcing level is still necessary. That’s where write-path level classifiers come into play.<br /> <br />But what does <strong>ranking</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>sourcing level</strong> mean? At Instagram, we have two steps to serve content to our community in Explore and hashtag pages:</p><ul><li>The <strong>sourcing step</strong> constitutes the queries necessary to find eligible content to show someone, with context on that person’s interests.</li><li>The <strong>ranking step </strong>takes eligible content and ranks it according to a given algorithm/model.</li></ul><p>We learned the following when it came to finding eligible content at the sourcing level:</p><ul><li><strong>You need filters at sourcing level for low </strong><a href="https://transparency.facebook.com/community-standards-enforcement/guide"><strong>prevalence</strong></a><strong> issues. </strong>Low prevalence violations are a very small volume of your training data, meaning content may be overlooked by your read-path models. Therefore, using an upload path classifier makes a lot of sense in these cases, and provides protection for these low prevalence issues.</li><li><strong>You need high precision filters to provide basic protection across all surfaces. </strong>If you only source “bad” content and leave the filtering to happen only at the ranking step, you will end up with not a lot of content to rank, reducing the effectiveness of your ranking algorithms. Therefore, it’s important for you to guarantee a good standard at sourcing to ensure most of the content you are sourcing is benign.</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion: the combination of basic protection at sourcing, fine tuned filtering at ranking, and a read-path model allowed us to uphold a high quality standard of content on Explore. However, it’s important to always keep in mind that your protection at sourcing should always be high precision and low volume to avoid mistakes.</strong></p><h3>Learning 4: Tracking model performance is not only a good engineering practice, it’s also a must for user empathy.</h3><p>This is something that goes beyond engineering, but it’s been a key to our work. When working on quality, it’s important for you to measure the performance of the models that you use in production. There are two reasons why:</p><ul><li>Having a precision and recall measurement calculated daily can help quickly identify when your model is decaying or when you have a problem in performance of one of the underlying features. It can also help alert you to a sudden change in the ecosystem.</li><li>Understanding how your models perform can help you understand how to improve. A low precision model means your users may have a poor experience.</li></ul><p>Having those metrics and a way to visualize the content labeled as “bad” has been a crucial improvement for our team. These dashboards allow our engineers to quickly identify any movement in metrics, and visualize the types of content violations required to improve the model, accelerating feature development and model iteration.<br /> <br /> <strong>Conclusion: monitor your precision and recall curve daily, and make sure you understand the type of content being filtered out. That will help you identify issues, and quickly improve on your existing models.</strong></p><h3>Learning 5: Don’t use raw thresholds! Think about calibrating your model daily or filtering using percentiles.</h3><p>We learned a lot by using raw thresholds as filters and adapted accordingly. Facebook is a complex ecosystem, and models have many underlying dependencies that could break and affect the upstream features of your model. This in turn can impact score distribution.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-cnV9_UCGbIjWy0W5NTVtw.png" /><figcaption>Scores can be very volatile (like the scores above), so it’s important for you to be ready and prepared when changes in distribution occur.</figcaption></figure><p>Overall, the issue with using raw thresholds is that they are too volatile. Any small change can cause unexpected fluctuations on surfaces, especially when suddenly you have a big metric movement from one day to the next.</p><p>As a solution, we recommend a calibration dataset to perform a daily calibration of your models, or a percentile filtering mechanism. We recently moved both our content filter and ranking frameworks to use percentiles, allowing us to have a more stable infrastructure, and we aim to establish a a calibration framework in the coming months.<br /> <br /> <strong>Conclusion: use a percentile framework instead of raw thresholds, or consider calibrating your scores against a daily updated dataset.</strong></p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>Maintaining the safety of Instagram is imperative to our mission as a company, but it is a difficult area across our industry. For us, it’s critical to take novel approaches when tackling quality problems on our service, and not to rely on approaches learned in more traditional ML ranking projects. To wrap up, here are some of our key takeaways:</p><ul><li>Operationalizing a quality metric is important and you should always think if there are ways of relying more on machine learning to scale your human labels.</li><li>Always think holistically about about how to apply quality enforcement on your ranking flow and try to think about integrating models on multiple layers of your system to achieve the best results.</li><li>Always remember that the experience of those using your service is your most important priority, and make sure you have tools that visualize, monitor and calibrate the models you are using in production, to guarantee the best experience possible.</li></ul><h3>Want to learn more?</h3><p>If you want to learn more about this work or are interested joining one of our engineering teams, please visit our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/jobs/?q=instagram">careers page</a>, follow us <a href="https://www.facebook.com/instagramengineering/">on Facebook</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/instagrameng">on Twitter</a>.</p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=5031b1342bea" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/five-things-i-learned-about-working-on-content-quality-at-instagram-5031b1342bea">Five things I learned about working on content quality at Instagram</a> was originally published in <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com">Instagram Engineering</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p></p>

        <h2>Instagram Data Saver Mode</h2>
        </a>
            
            <p><span class="company">Instagram Engineering - Medium</span>: <p>We recently shipped Data Saver Mode, a new feature on Instagram for Android that helps the app consume less mobile data. In this post, we’ll go over why we decided to work on this feature, our approach in developing it, the engineering implementation, and how people were impacted by it.</p><h3>Motivation</h3><p>The motivation behind building Data Saver Mode was threefold: <br /> <br /> First, research suggested many people felt constrained while using Instagram because it consumed a big percentage of their data. We ran a survey in a few different countries (United States, Great Britain, India, Indonesia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, Argentina) in early 2018, which asked the question ‘How much data does Instagram use?’. More than 50% of respondents selected ‘a lot more than I expect’ or ‘a little more than I expect’. Furthermore, 30% of respondents said they run out of data every month, and 28% of people said they would use Instagram more if there was a Data Saver Mode feature.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/912/1*DFLQYzOGL6yMpXmN28iP7g.png" /></figure><p>The second motivation was that we noticed Instagram would consume more data than we had initially desired. Intuitively, this made sense, as the more someone uses Instagram, the more content is consumed. However, we did note that overall data efficiency (i.e, time spent using the actual app for every megabyte of data consumed) could be improved. To illustrate, below you can see how IG data efficiency ranked below than that of Facebook, Facebook Lite, and WhatsApp.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/906/1*175rQDikkglstR5XvhHXNg.png" /></figure><p>The third motivation was Android’s Native Data Saver feature, which was starting to gain traction among users. From Android 7.0 onwards, people can enable Data Saver for the entire device. When enabled, the system will block background use of cellular data, as well as signaling the app to consume less data while in the foreground. We have used IG while having native Data Saver mode on, and because our app is media-heavy, this native implementation causes a disruptive user experience, as photos and videos would either load very slowly, or simply not load at all.<br /> <br />Google provides APIs to check whether someone has turned on Data Saver at the system level, but has not provided a way for developers to change native Data Saver implementation at the application level [1]. People can also restrict apps in native Data Saver, so if someone enables Data Saver, they could restrict IG and use our custom Data Saver Mode instead, for a less disruptive user experience.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*4voTJESXqvrKWdqhHLPV_w.png" /></figure><h3>Levers</h3><p>Below are the levers that we used for our Data Saver implementation:<br /> <br /> <strong>1. Disabling Video Prefetch</strong><br /> We currently prefetch upcoming videos in a person’s feed and stories viewer so that the videos are ready to play when a user arrives to a video on screen. We hypothesized that this behavior uses more data, especially if the user does not end up scrolling to the upcoming videos later in the feed. Thus, we can disable video prefetch so that we are only fetching video content when the user has paused their scrolling at a video, indicating they are watching the video. This would reduce data usage since a person may not want to watch all videos they are scrolling through in their feed.<br /> <br /> <strong>2. Disabling Video Auto Play</strong><br /> We currently automatically play all videos when they become visible on screen without user interaction. We hypothesized that this behavior uses more data, especially if the user does not intend to watch every single video that they scroll through. Thus, we can disable autoplay, and display a play button to allow users to manually play videos. This is a more drastic version of disabling video prefetch, since it requires extra user interaction to engage with a video media.<br /> <br /> <strong>3. Reducing media quality/resolution</strong><br /> Currently, we decide image and video resolution based on constraints such as a user’s connectivity and bandwidth. Rendering high resolution media is going to consume more data than low resolution media, given the larger file size. This can matter quite a bit for users in unique connectivity situations, which can be difficult to detect at the application level. For example, people using pocket mobile will appear as if they are on wifi, when in reality, they are using cellular data. Thus, we can provide a setting for users to decide at what connectivity setting they want to view higher resolution media. This allows users to still browse the content they care about, without using too much data.<br /> <br />The tradeoff with enabling the above three levers is that we want to ensure users still have a consistent browsing experience with reasonable media loading time, given that Instagram is a media-heavy app.</p><h3>Approach</h3><p>At Instagram, we understand that a meaningful portion of our users are in markets where connectivity can only be accessed through mobile cellular data, as opposed to at-home connectivity (i.e, WiFi). Demand for affordable connectivity has grown, so the cost of data becomes a key factor in a user’s decision to engage with online content. While we can primarily look at emerging markets, there are also industrial countries where the high cost of data means that a considerable part of the population is also data-conscious. Taking all this into account, we tested in Indonesia, India, Argentina, Germany and France. The team tested several different variants of Data Saver with the above three parameters, and with variants that displayed user-visible options for disabling autoplay and controlling media quality.<br /> <br /> During this first country test, we found that disabling video prefetch provided a good balance of reducing data usage while still providing a reasonable browsing experience. Predictably, by not auto-playing video content, people consumed less video. However, we also saw that people valued explicit control over media quality and auto-play.<br /> <br /> We found that there were two variants that tied as best performing test variants:</p><ol><li>Disabling video prefetching. Option of choosing when to receive High Resolution Media (“Never”, <br />“only on Wi-Fi”, or “both on Wi-Fi and cellular”), with selection defaulted to “only on Wi-Fi”</li><li>Disabling video prefetching. Option of choosing when to receive High Resolution Media (“Never”, <br />“only on Wi-Fi”, or “both on Wi-Fi and cellular”), with selection defaulted to “both on Wi-Fi and cellular”</li></ol><p>The variants are the same, the only difference is that the default selection is different (“only on Wi-Fi” and “both on Wi-Fi and cellular”) for the High Resolution Media option. Each performed better in certain countries, so we decided we would do another country test in Canada and Great Britain (as previous research had shown these countries are also data conscious). This informed our decision to finally test globally and launch to everyone.<br /> <br /> For our global launch, we decided to keep the High Resolution Media user option and defaulted it to “only on Wi-Fi”.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/826/1*WDzBe_vdtWE8f6P6NJV6dQ.jpeg" /></figure><h3>User Impact</h3><p>For our test in CA &amp; GB, the best performing version was the one that disabled video prefetching and defaulted to high resolution media on both Wi-Fi and Cellular. Note that as this is an opt-in feature and only ~10% of people in the test group opted in, so the results we saw in our A/B test were quite diluted. Nonetheless, we saw a sizable decrease in data usage while on cellular. We also saw increases in number of interactions, number of media created, and other engagement metrics. These were significant wins, especially when you take into account that only 10% of users in the test group were driving them. Finally, we only saw regressions in video loading metrics, which we expected from our disabling of video prefetching, but they were not too big. <br /> <br /> In our CA &amp; GB test, 1.6% of users in the default high resolution media only on Wi-Fi switched to high resolution media on both Wi-Fi and Cellular, and 10% of users in the default high resolution media on both Wi-Fi and Cellular switched to high resolution media only on Wi-Fi. Admittedly, we are not entirely certain as to why we saw this large difference, but one of our hypotheses is that people who are <em>very</em> conscious about their data consumption are more likely to actively employ options to conserve data. <br /> <br /> For our global test, the best performing version was the one that disabled video prefetching and defaulted to high resolution media only on Wi-Fi. This test was done through a less targeted lens, but we still saw improvements in engagement and data consumption on cellular. Given all of these positive results, we concluded this feature would be very beneficial for data-constrained users and we shipped it globally in June 2019.</p><h3>Appendix</h3><p>[1] <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/basics/network-ops/data-saver">https://developer.android.com/training/basics/network-ops/data-saver</a></p><p>The Data Saver Mode feature wouldn’t have been possible without the collaboration of research, data, engineering, and product.

        <h2>Powered by AI: Instagram’s Explore recommender system</h2>
        </a>
            
            <p><span class="company">Instagram Engineering - Medium</span>: <p><em>This post was originally published on the </em><a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/powered-by-ai-instagrams-explore-recommender-system/."><em>Facebook AI blog</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Over half of the Instagram community visits <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/">Instagram Explore</a> every month to discover new photos, videos, and Stories relevant to their interests. Recommending the most relevant content out of billions of options in real time at scale introduces multiple machine learning (ML) challenges that require novel engineering solutions.</p><p>We tackled these challenges by creating a series of custom query languages, lightweight modeling techniques, and tools enabling high-velocity experimentation. These systems support the scale of Explore while boosting developer efficiency. Collectively, these solutions represent an AI system based on a highly efficient 3-part ranking funnel that extracts 65 billion features and makes 90 million model predictions <strong>every second</strong>.</p><p>In this blog post, we’re sharing the first detailed overview of the key elements that make Explore work, and how we provide personalized content for people on Instagram.</p><a href="https://medium.com/media/ef831e9f51cde59eeb4faab1e1ee952b/href">https://medium.com/media/ef831e9f51cde59eeb4faab1e1ee952b/href</a><h3>Developing foundational building blocks of Explore</h3><p>Before we could execute on building a recommendation engine that tackles the sheer volume of photos and videos uploaded daily on Instagram, we developed foundational tools to address three important needs. We needed the ability to conduct rapid experimentation at scale, we needed to obtain a stronger signal on the breadth of people’s interests, and we needed a computationally efficient way to ensure that our recommendations were both high quality and fresh. These custom techniques were key to achieving our goals:</p><h4>Iterating quickly with IGQL: A new domain-specific language</h4><p>Building the optimal recommendation algorithms and techniques is an ongoing area of research in the ML community, and the process of choosing the right system can vary widely depending on the task. For instance, while one algorithm may effectively identify long-term interests, another may perform better at identifying recommendations based on recent content. Our engineering team iterates on different algorithms, and we needed a way for us to both try out new ideas efficiently and apply the promising ideas to large-scale systems easily without worrying too much about computational resource implications like CPU and memory usage. We needed a custom domain specific meta-language that provides the right level of abstraction and assembles all algorithms into one place.</p><p>To solve this, we created and shipped IGQL, a domain-specific language optimized for retrieving candidates in recommender systems. Its execution is optimized in C++, which helps minimize both latency and compute resources. It’s also extensible and easy to use when testing new research ideas. IGQL is both statically validated and high-level. Engineers can write recommendation algorithms in a Python-like way and execute fast and efficiently in C++.</p><pre>user<br />.let(seed_id=user_id)<br />.liked(max_num_to_retrieve=30)<br />.account_nn(embedding_config=default)<br />.posted_media(max_media_per_account=10)<br />.filter(non_recommendable_model_threshold=0.2)<br />.rank(ranking_model=default)<br />.diversify_by(seed_id, method=round_robin)</pre><p>In the code sample above, you can see how IGQL provides high readability even for engineers who haven’t worked extensively in the language. It helps assemble multiple recommendation stages and algorithms in a principled way. For example, we can optimize the ensemble of candidate generators by using a combiner rule in query to output a weighted blend of several subquery outputs. By tweaking their weights, we can find the combination that results in the best user experience.</p><p>IGQL makes it simple to perform tasks that are common in complex recommendation systems, such as building nested trees of combiner rules. IGQL lets engineers focus on ML and business logic behind recommendations as opposed to logistics, like fetching the right quantity of candidates for each query. It also provides a high degree of code reusability. For instance, applying a ranker is as simple as adding a one-line rule to our IGQL query. It’s trivial to add it in multiple places, like ranking accounts and ranking media posted by those accounts.</p><h4>Account embeddings for personalized ranking inventory</h4><p>People publicly share billions of high quality pieces of media on Instagram that are eligible inventory for Explore. It’s challenging to maintain a clear and ever-evolving catalog-style taxonomy for the large variety of interest communities on Explore — with topics varying from Arabic calligraphy to model trains to slime. As a result, content-based models have difficulty grasping such a variety of interest-based communities.</p><p>Because Instagram has a large number of interest-focused accounts based on specific themes — such as Devon rex cats or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/vintagetractors/">vintage tractors</a> — we created a retrieval pipeline that focuses on account-level information rather than media-level. By building account embeddings, we’re able to more efficiently identify which accounts are topically similar to each other. We infer account embeddings using ig2vec, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec">word2vec</a>-like embedding framework. Typically, the word2vec embedding framework learns a representation of a word based on its context across sentences in the training corpus. Ig2vec treats account IDs that a user interacts with — e.g., a person likes media from an account — as a sequence of words in a sentence.</p><p>By applying the same techniques from word2vec, we can predict accounts with which a person is likely to interact in a given session within the Instagram app. If an individual interacts with a sequence of accounts in the same session, it’s more likely to be topically coherent compared with a random sequence of accounts from the diverse range of Instagram accounts. This helps us identify topically similar accounts.</p><p>We define a distance metric between two accounts — the same one used in embedding training — which is usually cosine distance or dot product. Based on this, we do a KNN lookup to find topically similar accounts for any account in the embedding. Our embedding version covers millions of accounts, and we <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/tools/faiss/">use Facebook’s state-of-the-art nearest neighbor retrieval engine, FAISS</a>, as the supporting retrieval infrastructure.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*L8XlYDF2i6ziTrH4" /></figure><p>For each version of the embedding, we train a classifier to predict a set of accounts’ topic solely based on the embedding. By comparing the predicted topics with human-labeled topics for accounts in a hold-out set, we can assess how well the embeddings capture topical similarity.</p><p>Retrieving accounts that are similar to those that a particular person previously expressed interest in helps us narrow down to a smaller, personalized ranking inventory for each person in a simple yet effective way. As a result, we are able to utilize state-of-the-art and computationally intensive ML models to serve every Instagram community member.</p><h4>Preselecting relevant candidates by using model distillation</h4><p>After we use ig2vec to identify the most relevant accounts based on individual interests, we need a way to rank these accounts in a way that’s fresh and interesting for everyone. This requires predicting the most relevant media for each person every time they scroll the Explore page.</p><p>For instance, evaluating even just 500 media pieces through a deep neural network for every scrolling action requires a large amount of resources. And yet the more posts we evaluate for each user, the higher the possibility we have of finding the best, most personalized media from their inventory.</p><p>In order to be able to maximize the number of media for each ranking request, we introduced a ranking distillation model that helps us preselect candidates before using more complex ranking models. Our approach is to train a super-lightweight model that learns from and tries to approximate our main ranking models as much as possible. We record the input candidates with features, as well as outputs, from our more complicated ranking models. The distillation model is then trained on this recorded data with a limited set of features and a simpler neural network model structure to replicate the results. Its objective function is to optimize for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain">NDCG ranking</a> (a measure of ranking quality) loss over main ranking model’s output. We use the top-ranked posts from the distillation model as the ranking candidates for the later-stage high-performance ranking models.</p><p>Setting up the distillation model’s mimicry behavior minimizes the need to tune multiple parameters and maintain multiple models in different ranking stages. Leveraging this technique, we can efficiently evaluate a bigger set of media to find the most relevant media on every ranking request while keeping the computational resources under control.</p><h3>How we built Explore</h3><p>After creating the key building blocks necessary to experiment easily, identify people’s interests effectively, and produce efficient and relevant predictions, we had to combine these systems together in production. Utilizing IGQL, account embeddings, and our distillation technique, we split the Explore recommendation systems into two main stages: the candidate generation stage (also known as sourcing stage) and the ranking stage.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*PEd-3mt3ORfSABWo" /><figcaption>An overview of the Explore system.</figcaption></figure><h3>Candidate Generation</h3><p>First, we leverage accounts that people have interacted with before (e.g., liked or saved media from an account) on Instagram to identify which other accounts people might be interested in. We call them the seed accounts. The seed accounts are usually only a fraction of the accounts on Instagram that are about similar or the same interests. Then, we use account embeddings techniques to identify accounts similar to the seed accounts. Finally, based on these accounts, we’re able to find the media that these accounts posted or engaged with.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*lZv-WWAQxtPt_LEp" /><figcaption>This graphic shows a typical source for Instagram Explore recommendations.</figcaption></figure><p>There are many different ways people can engage with accounts and media on Instagram (e.g., follow, like, comment, save, and share). There are also different media types (e.g., photo, video, Stories, and Live), which means there are a variety of sources we can construct using a similar scheme. Leveraging IGQL, the process becomes very easy — different candidate sources are just represented as different IGQL subqueries.</p><p>With different types of sources, we are able to find tens of thousands of eligible candidates for the average person. We want to make sure the content we recommend is both safe and appropriate for a global community of many ages on Explore. Using a variety of signals, we filter out content we can identify as not being eligible to be recommended before we build out eligible inventory for each person. In addition to blocking likely policy-violating content and misinformation, we leverage ML systems that help detect and filter content like spam.</p><p>Then, for every ranking request, we identify thousands of eligible media for an average person, sample 500 candidates from the eligible inventory, and then send the candidates downstream to the ranking stage.</p><h3>Ranking candidates</h3><p>With 500 candidates available for ranking, we use a three-stage ranking infrastructure to help balance the trade-offs between ranking relevance and computation efficiency. The three ranking stages we have are as follows:</p><ol><li>First pass: the distillation model mimics the combination of the other two stages, with minimal features; picks the 150 highest-quality and most relevant candidates out of 500.</li><li>Second pass: a lightweight neural network model with full set of dense features; picks the 50 highest-quality and most relevant candidates.</li><li>Final pass: a deep neural network model with full set of dense and sparse features. Picks the 25 highest-quality and most relevant candidates (for the first page of Explore grid).</li></ol><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*msYNIGXyd3-964NenvhG_g.gif" /><figcaption>This animation describes the three-part ranking infrastructure we use to balance trade-offs between ranking relevance and computation efficiency.</figcaption></figure><p>If the first-pass distillation model mimics the other two stages in ranking order, how do we decide the most relevant content in the next two stages? We predict individual actions that people take on each piece of media, whether they’re positive actions such as like and save, or negative actions such as “See Fewer Posts Like This” (SFPLT). We use a multi-task multi-label (MTML) neural network to predict these events. The shared multilayer perceptron (MLP) allows us to capture the common signals from different actions.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*rksyLANxSL7EYV00" /><figcaption>An illustration of our current final-pass model architecture.</figcaption></figure><p>We combine predictions of different events using an arithmetic formula, called value model, to capture the prominence of different signals in terms of deciding whether the content is relevant. We use a weighted sum of predictions such as [w_like * P(Like) + w_save * P(Save) — w_negative_action * P(Negative Action)]. If, for instance, we think the importance of a person saving a post on Explore is higher than their liking a post, then the weight for the save action should be higher.</p><p>We also want Explore to be a place where people can discover a rich balance of both new interests alongside existing interests. We add a simple heuristic rule into value model to boost the diversity of content. We down-rank posts from the same author or same seed account by adding a penalty factor, so you don’t see multiple posts from the same person or the same seed account in Explore. This penalty increases as you go down the ranked batch and encounter more posts from the same author.</p><p>We rank the most relevant content based on the final value model score of each ranking candidate in a descendant way. Our offline replay tool — along with <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fresearch.fb.com%2Fefficient-tuning-of-online-systems-using-bayesian-optimization%2F&amp;h=AT02CIAbh2DehM6qp72BVONwqz-REZ_Y77mODKs8HjO4zH8gKzmZ268bP_IhXs7oMlskQxUYY_MB29qmW5e2qT3txxjfwYmFOjOmWkjhC-bzVLmS8k4WrRK0R24kBJXT5-tq7nMJq0FsZxS5CfvWYOZI">Bayesian optimization tools</a> — helps us tune the value model efficiently and frequently as our systems evolve.</p><h3>An ongoing ML challenge</h3><p>One of the most exciting parts of building Explore is the ongoing challenge of finding new and interesting ways to help our community discover the most interesting and relevant content on Instagram. We’re continuously evolving Instagram Explore, whether by adding media formats like Stories and entry points to new types of content, such as shopping posts and IGTV videos.</p><p>The scale of both the Instagram community and inventory requires enabling a culture of high-velocity experimentation and developer efficiency to reliably recommend the best of Instagram for each person’s individual interests. Our custom tools and systems have given us a strong foundation for the continuous learning and iteration that are essential to building and scaling Instagram Explore.</p><p>If you want to learn more about this work or are interested joining one of our engineering teams, please visit our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/jobs/?q=instagram">careers page</a>, follow us <a href="https://www.facebook.com/instagramengineering/">on Facebook</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/instagrameng">on Twitter</a>.</p><p><em>Written by Ivan Medvedev, Haotian Wu, and Taylor Gordon.</em></p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=7ca901d2a882" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/powered-by-ai-instagrams-explore-recommender-system-7ca901d2a882">Powered by AI: Instagram’s Explore recommender system</a> was originally published in <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com">Instagram Engineering</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p></p>

        <h2>10 Questions with Shupin Mao, Well-being tech lead</h2>
        </a>
            
            <p><span class="company">Instagram Engineering - Medium</span>: <p>Shupin Mao is a senior software engineer at Facebook. During her last four years at the company, Shupin helped several teams and gained experience across Instagram and Facebook, including the <a href="https://wellbeing.instagram.com/">Instagram Well-being</a> team. Here she shares what got her into engineering, favorite moments, lessons learned, and more.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZQwaKQcTLRoYO7Pa57oXrg.jpeg" /></figure><p><strong>How</strong> <strong>did you become an engineer?</strong></p><p>When working on course projects during my undergrad and grad study, I felt the passion for solving coding problems, which was the main motivation to apply for an engineering position after graduation. After joining Facebook, I was still motivated to solve practical problems every day and learn new skills/knowledge, which affirmed my career choice.</p><p><strong>What</strong> <strong>was your first coding language?</strong></p><p>C was my first coding language back to school days. Objective-C was my first coding language at my full-time work at Facebook.</p><p><strong>What</strong> <strong>do you listen to while you work?</strong></p><p>All kinds of piano songs which can help me keep focused. For example, Ghibli’s relaxing piano pieces are good.</p><p><strong>What</strong> <strong>do you do when you get stuck on a problem?</strong></p><p>I will usually take a short walk to the nearest snack kitchen and look for some snacks. I feel walking and eating can help me think better.</p><p><strong>Tell</strong> <strong>us about your favorite project at Instagram?</strong></p><ul><li>My favorite project at Instagram was the work we did to combat drug and firearms sales, together with the Facebook Community Integrity team. It was one of our first projects collaborating with this team. The project itself was exciting: we adopted a new machine learning model technology, and we shipped several models to production.</li><li>The part I valued most was the amazing collaboration experience across different teams, including cross-functional partners such as privacy, policy, and legal.</li></ul><p><strong>What</strong> <strong>makes working at Instagram unique?</strong></p><ul><li>Instagram has fewer engineers compared to Facebook (the app), while being responsible for a product as important as other FB products. So it’s quite common for Instagram engineers to be responsible for large scope of work.</li><li>Instagram has a flatter management structure. There are more opportunities to communicate or present directly to org leads. Bigger scope and more direct/transparent communication make me feel stronger ownership and fulfillment of my projects and work.</li></ul><p><strong>How</strong> <strong>would you describe the engineering culture at Instagram?</strong></p><ul><li>We valued user experience and user privacy highly. We treated all users’ experience very seriously. A lot of projects were driven by user reports or feedback. We also worked very closely with legal, policy, and privacy. Every project or product change needs to be extremely carefully discussed and reviewed by these experts.</li><li>On our team, we leave 20% of our time to deal with ad-hoc or unexpected issues.</li><li>A very respectful and supportive work environment. We value the culture of “<a href="http://www.guidetoallyship.com/">Be the Ally</a>” very much in our org. I personally benefit a lot and also contribute to this valuable culture in my daily work.</li><li>A Data-driven approach. We valued data analysis highly in Instagram. Most of the projects have very analytical goals. We tracked metrics closely in our daily work.</li><li>Fun and optimistic and positive working atmosphere. People here are very good at bringing fun into work. You can hear a lot of fun stories or jokes during Q&amp;A or meetings. Even during the intense times, you can still see people making fun with each other and encouraging each other (work was still completed with high efficiency and quality).</li></ul><p><strong>What</strong> <strong>makes you excited about coming into work every day?</strong></p><p>Exciting projects and brilliant colleagues.</p><p><strong>Your favorite place to eat in the city?</strong></p><p>A lot of Chinese restaurants :)</p><p><strong>What is your favorite thing to eat at the office?</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.pocky.com/">Pocky</a> in strawberry flavor</p><p><strong>What’s your favorite Instagram account?</strong></p><p>@<a href="https://www.instagram.com/kuviabear/?hl=en">kuviabear</a>, I like following the sweet daily life of cute Kuvia!</p><p><strong>Tell us about your happiest day at Instagram.</strong></p><ul><li>To be honest, it’s hard to choose which was the happiest day at Instagram. I still remember the first day I walked into our building and sat with my team. I was so impressed by all the decorations inside the building, also the sweet corner views from my desk.</li><li>I also remember all the relaxing casual conversations that happened in micro-kitchen during or after happy hours, so many fun jokes and laughs.</li><li>And there are also intense but exciting days near deadlines, when everyone was fighting for the same goal within such a short amount of time. I remember how thrilled and excited the whole team was when we hit our goal or launched the projects.</li></ul><p><strong>What is one of the best things you learned while working at Instagram?</strong></p><p>I gained a lot of valuable experience in coordination and collaborations across teams/roles in Instagram. I would say Instagram may provide the best example on how engineers and cross-function team members, such as product, legal, privacy expert, work together among the whole company. And my team has many cross team partners, most of them are located remotely. The projects I worked on provided me a lot of great opportunities to learn how to work with different teams and people closely and smoothly.</p><p><strong>What does your desk setup look like?</strong></p><p>One monitor and one Apple Mac Pro (I got it for iOS development and I probably should return it now 😂).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*2X_6j0i5Zj2SHbT8-NPgYw.jpeg" /></figure><p><strong>What was your favorite offsite?</strong></p><p>Well-being Team Offsite at <a href="https://www.claybythebaysf.com/">Clay By The Bay</a>. We had a great day on learning and practicing working with clay. And my favorite part was that we received our “work” as the outcome :P.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YnipUDa3loTglNdLUNyhnw.jpeg" /></figure><p>If you want to learn more about this work or are interested joining one of our engineering teams, please visit our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/jobs/?q=instagram">careers page</a>, follow us <a href="https://www.facebook.com/instagramengineering/">on Facebook</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/instagrameng">on Twitter</a>.</p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3b19f19b168d" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/10-questions-with-shupin-mao-well-being-tech-lead-3b19f19b168d">10 Questions with Shupin Mao, Well-being tech lead</a> was originally published in <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com">Instagram Engineering</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p></p>

        <h2>Making instagram.com faster: Code size and execution optimizations (Part 4)</h2>
        </a>
            
            <p><span class="company">Instagram Engineering - Medium</span>: <p>In recent years <a href="http://instagram.com/">instagram.com</a> has seen a lot of changes — we’ve launched stories, filters, creation tools, notifications, and direct messaging as well as a myriad of other features and enhancements. However, as the product grew, a side effect was that our web performance began to slow. Over the last year we made a conscious effort to improve this. This ongoing effort has thus far resulted in almost 50% cumulative improvement to our feed page load time. This series of blog posts will outline some of the work we’ve done that led to these improvements. In <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/making-instagram-com-faster-part-1-62cc0c327538">part 1</a> we talked about prefetching data, in <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/making-instagram-com-faster-part-2-f350c8fba0d4">part 2</a> we talked about improving performance by pushing data directly to the client rather than waiting for the client to request the data, and in <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/making-instagram-com-faster-part-3-cache-first-6f3f130b9669">part 3</a> we talked about cache-first rendering.</p><h3>Code size and execution optimizations</h3><p>In parts 1–3 we covered various ways that we optimized the loading patterns of the critical path static resources and data queries. However there is another key area we haven’t covered yet that’s crucial to improving web application performance, particularly on low-end devices — <strong>ship less code to the user </strong>— in particular, <em>ship less JavaScript</em>. <br /> <br /> This might seem obvious, but there are a few points to consider here. There’s a common assumption in the industry that the size of the JavaScript that gets downloaded over the network is what’s important (i.e. the size <em>post-compression</em>), however we found that what’s really important is the size <em>pre-compression</em> as this is what has to be parsed and executed on the user’s device, even if it’s cached locally. This becomes particularly true if you have a site with many repeat users (and subsequent high browser cache hit rates) or users accessing your site on mobile devices. In these cases the parsing and execution performance of JavaScript on the CPU becomes the limiting factor rather than the network download time. For example, when we implemented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli">Brotli</a> compression for our JavaScript assets, we saw a nearly 20% reduction of post-compression size across the wire, but <strong><em>NO</em></strong> statistically significant reduction in the overall page load times as seen by end users. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, we’ve found reductions in pre-compression JavaScript size have consistently led to performance improvements. It’s also worth making a distinction between JavaScript that is executed on the critical path and JavaScript that is dynamically imported after the main page has completed. While ideally it would be nice to reduce the total amount of JavaScript in an application, a key thing to optimize in the short term is the amount of eagerly executed JavaScript on the critical path (we track this with a metric we call Critical Bytes Per Route). Dynamically imported JavaScript that lazy loads is generally not going to have as significant an effect on page load performance, so it’s a valid strategy to move non-visible or interaction dependent UI components out of the initial page bundles and into dynamically imported bundles. <br /> <br /> Refactoring our UI to reduce the amount of script on the critical path is going to be essential to improving performance in the long term — but this is a significant undertaking which will take time. In the short-term we worked on a number of projects to improve the size and execution efficiency of our existing code in ways that are largely transparent to product developers and require little refactoring of existing product code.</p><h3>Inline requires</h3><p>We bundle our frontend web assets using <a href="https://facebook.github.io/metro/">Metro</a> (the same bundler used by React Native) so we get access to inline-requires out of the box. Inline-requires moves the cost of requiring/importing modules to the first time when they are actually used. This means that you can avoid paying execution cost for unused features (though you’ll still pay the cost of downloading and parsing them) and you can better amortize the execution cost over the application startup, rather than having a large amount of upfront computation.</p><a href="https://medium.com/media/d5a33f7e41003f8608fb033886056f4f/href">https://medium.com/media/d5a33f7e41003f8608fb033886056f4f/href</a><p>To see how this works in practice, lets take the following example code:</p><a href="https://medium.com/media/723e856b1fbaf18256da74cd88977ba5/href">https://medium.com/media/723e856b1fbaf18256da74cd88977ba5/href</a><p>Using inline requires this would get transformed into something like the following (you’ll find these inline requires by searching for r(d[ in the Instagram JS source in your browser developer tools)</p><a href="https://medium.com/media/ef2f1d723b91b0778b00348042b3b307/href">https://medium.com/media/ef2f1d723b91b0778b00348042b3b307/href</a><p>As we can see, it essentially works by replacing the local references to a required module with a function call to require that module. This means that unless the code from that module is actually used, the module is never required (and therefore never executed). In most cases this works extremely well, but there are a couple of edge cases to be aware of that can cause problems — namely modules with side effects. For example:</p><a href="https://medium.com/media/7a43ec94aaf8dc6abb832293b35f608e/href">https://medium.com/media/7a43ec94aaf8dc6abb832293b35f608e/href</a><p>Without inline requires, Module C would output {'foo':'bar'}, but when we enable inline-requires, it would output undefined, because B has an implicit dependency on A. This is a contrived example, but there are other real world cases where this can have effects i.e. what if a module does some logging as a part of its initialization - enabling inline-requires could cause this logging to stop happening. This is mostly preventable through linters that check for code that executes immediately at the module scope level, but there were some files we had to blacklist from this optimization such as runtime polyfills that need to execute immediately. After experimenting enabling inline requires across the codebase we saw an improvement in our Feed TTI (time to interactive) by 12% and Display Done by 9.8%, and decided that dealing with some of these minor edge cases was worth it for the performance improvements.</p><h3>Serving ES2017 bundles to modern browsers</h3><p>One of the primary drivers that drove the adoption of compiler/transpiler tools like Babel was allowing developers to use modern JavaScript coding idioms but still have their applications work in browsers that lacked native support for these latest language features. Since then a number of other important use-cases for these tools arose including compile-to-js languages like Typescript and ReasonML, language extensions such as JSX and Flow type annotations, and build time AST manipulations for things like internationalization. Because of this, it’s unlikely that this extra compilation step is going to go disappear from frontend development workflows any time soon. However, with that said it’s worth revisiting if the original purpose for doing this (cross browser compatibility) is still necessary in 2019.<br /> <br /> ES2015 and more recent features like async/await are now well supported across recent versions of most major browsers, so directly serving JavaScript containing these newer features is definitely possible — but there are two key questions that we had to answer first:</p><ul><li>Would enough users be able to take advantage of this to make the extra build complexity worthwhile (as you’d still need to maintain the legacy transpiling step for older browsers),</li><li>And what (if any) are the performance advantages of shipping ES2015+ features</li></ul><p>To answer the first question we first had to determine which features we were going to ship without transpiling/polyfilling and how many build variants we wanted to support for the different browsers. We settled on having two builds, one that would require support for ES2017 syntax, and a legacy build that would transpile back to ES5 (in addition we also added an optional polyfill bundle that would only be added for legacy browsers that lacked runtime support for more recent DOM API’s). Detecting support for these groups is done via some basic user-agent sniffing on the server side which ensures there is no runtime cost or extra roundtrip time from doing client-side detection of which bundles to load.</p><a href="https://medium.com/media/4971b12bb97da1ea896c832172f19d57/href">https://medium.com/media/4971b12bb97da1ea896c832172f19d57/href</a><p>With this in mind, we ran the numbers and determined that 56% of users to <a href="http://instagram.com">instagram.com</a> are able to be served the ES2017 build without any transpiling or runtime polyfills, and considering that this percentage is only going to go up over time — it seems like its worth supporting two builds considering the number of users able to utilize it.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/627/1*HDLCFPZCIfOpVWMSYz4HOg.png" /><figcaption>Percentage of Instagram users with ES2017 supported vs unsupported browsers</figcaption></figure><p>As for the second question — what are the performance advantages of shipping ES2017 directly — lets start by looking at what Babel actually does to transpile some common constructs back to ES5. In the left hand column is the ES2017 code, and on the right is the transpiled ES5 compatible version.</p><h4>Class (ES2017 vs ES5)</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/815/1*2_e9ARhf2RfO0rGy7aSA4w.png" /></figure><h4>Async/Await (ES2017 vs ES5)</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/818/1*WqgXcDXCe9r9xdhfcxPiQA.png" /></figure><h4>Arrow functions (ES2017 vs ES5)</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/815/1*_b476jWcR3BNPRErC7JlxQ.png" /></figure><h4>Rest parameters (ES2017 vs ES5)</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/817/1*WNRff6CfGqEAb4m1jZO_sQ.png" /></figure><h4>Destructuring assignment (ES2017 vs ES5)</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/818/1*Y8iA5py-J4NBdXPSfQ4cug.png" /></figure><p>From this we can see that there is a considerable size overhead in transpiling these constructs (even if you amortize the cost of some of the runtime helper functions over a large codebase). In the case of Instagram, we saw a 5.7% reduction in the size of our core consumer JavaScript bundles when we removed all ES2017 transpiling plugins from our build. In testing we found that the end-to-end load times for the feed page improved by 3% for users who were served the ES2017 bundle compared with those who were not.</p><h3>Still a long way to go</h3><p>While the progress that has been made so far is impressive, the work we’ve done so far represents just the beginning. Theres still a huge amount of room left for improvement in areas such as Redux store/reducer modularization, better code splitting, moving more JavaScript execution off the critical path, optimizing scroll performance, adjusting to different bandwidth conditions, and more. <br /> <br /> If you want to learn more about this work or are interested joining one of our engineering teams, please visit our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/jobs/?q=instagram">careers page</a>, follow us <a href="https://www.facebook.com/instagramengineering/">on Facebook</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/instagrameng">on Twitter</a>.</p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=57668be796a8" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/making-instagram-com-faster-code-size-and-execution-optimizations-part-4-57668be796a8">Making instagram.com faster: Code size and execution optimizations (Part 4)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com">Instagram Engineering</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p></p>

        <h2>Python at Scale: Strict Modules</h2>
        </a>
            
            <p><span class="company">Instagram Engineering - Medium</span>: <p>Welcome to the third post in our series on Python at scale at Instagram! As we mentioned in <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/static-analysis-at-scale-an-instagram-story-8f498ab71a0c">the first post in the series</a>, Instagram Server is a several-million-line Python monolith, and it moves quickly: hundreds of commits each day, deployed to production every few minutes.</p><p>We’ve run into a few pain points working with Python at that scale and speed. This article takes a look at a few that we imagine might impact others as well. <br /> <br /> Consider this innocuous-looking sample module:</p><pre>import re</pre><pre>from mywebframework import db, route</pre><pre>VALID_NAME_RE = re.compile(&quot;^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$&quot;)</pre><pre>@route('/')<br />def home():<br />    return &quot;Hello World!&quot;</pre><pre>class Person(db.Model):<br />    name: str</pre><p>When someone imports this module, what code will run?</p><ul><li>We’ll run a bunch of regex code to compile that string to a pattern object.</li><li>We’ll run the @route decorator. Based on what we see here, we can assume that it's probably registering this view in some url mapping. This means that just by importing this module, we're mutating global state somewhere else.</li><li>We’re going to run all the code inside the body of the Person class, which can include arbitrary code. And the Model base class might have a meta-class or an __init_subclass__ method, which is still more arbitrary code we might be running at import.</li></ul><h3>Pain area one: slow startup and reload</h3><p>The only line of code in this module that (probably) <strong>doesn’t</strong> run on import is return &quot;Hello World!&quot;, but we can't even say that for sure! So by just importing this simple eight line module (not even doing anything with it yet!), we are probably running hundreds, if not thousands of lines of Python code, not to mention modifying a global URL mapping somewhere else in our program.<br /> <br /> So what? This is part of what it means for Python to be a dynamic, interpreted language. This lets us do all kinds of useful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">meta-programming</a>. What's wrong with that?<br /> <br /> Nothing is wrong with it, when you're working with relatively small codebases and teams, and you can guarantee some level of discipline in how you use these features. But some aspects of this dynamism can become a concern when you have millions of lines of code worked on by hundreds of developers, many of whom are new to Python.<br /> <br /> For example, one of the great things about Python is how fast you can iterate with it: make a change and see the result, no compile needed! But with a few million lines of code (and a messy dependency graph), that advantage starts to turn sour.<br /> <br /> Our server startup takes over 20s, and sometimes regresses to more like a minute if we aren't paying attention to keeping it optimized. That means 20-60 seconds between a developer making a change and being able to see the results of that change in their browser, or even in a unit test. This, unfortunately, is the perfect amount of time to get distracted by something shiny and forget what you were doing. Most of that time is spent literally just importing modules, creating function and class objects.<br /> <br /> In some ways, that's no different from waiting for another language to compile. But typically compilation can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_compiler">incremental</a>: you can just recompile the stuff you changed and things that directly depend on it, so many smaller changes can compile quickly. But in Python, because imports can have arbitrary side effects, there is no safe way to incrementally reload our server. No matter how small the change, we have to start from scratch every time, importing all those modules, re-creating all those classes and functions, re-compiling all of those regular expressions, etc. Usually 99% of the code hasn't changed since last time we reloaded the server, but we have to re-do all that slow work anyway.<br /> <br /> In addition to slowing down developers, this is a significant amount of wasted compute in production, too, since we continuously deploy and are thus reloading the site on production servers constantly all day long.<br /> <br /> So that's our first pain point: slow server startup and reload due to lots of wasted repeat work at import time.</p><h3>Pain area two: unsafe import side effects</h3><p>Here’s another thing we often find developers doing at import time: fetching configuration from a network configuration source.</p><pre>MY_CONFIG = get_config_from_network_service()</pre><p>In addition to slowing down server startup even further, this is dangerous, too. If the network service is not available, we won’t just get a runtime error failing certain requests, our server will fail to start up.<br /> <br /> Let’s make this a bit worse, and imagine that someone has added some import-time code in another module that does some critical initialization of the network service. They don’t know where to put this code, so they stick it in some module that happens to get imported pretty early on. Everything works, so they move on.<br /> <br /> But then someone else comes along, adds an innocuous import in some other part of the codebase, and through an import chain twelve modules deep, it causes the config-fetching module to now be imported before the one that does the initialization.<br /> <br /> Now we’re trying to use the service before it’s initialized, so it blows up. In the best case, where the interaction is fully deterministic, this could still result in a developer tearing their hair out for an hour or two trying to understand why their innocent change is causing something unrelated to break. In a more complex case where it’s not fully deterministic, this could bring down production. And there’s no obvious way to generically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)">lint</a> against or prevent this category of issue.<br /> <br /> The root of the problem here is two factors that interact badly: <br /> 1) Python allows modules to have arbitrary and unsafe import side effects, and <br /> 2) the order of imports is not explicitly determined or controlled, it’s an emergent property of the imports present in all modules in the entire system (and can also vary based on the entry point to the system).</p><h3>Pain area 3: mutable global state</h3><p>Let’s look at one more category of common errors.</p><pre>def myview(request):<br />    SomeClass.id = request.GET.get(&quot;id&quot;)</pre><p>Here we’re in a view function, and we’re attaching an attribute to some class based on data from the request. Likely you’ve already spotted the problem: classes are global singletons, so we’re putting per-request state onto a long-lived object, and in a long-lived web server process, that has the potential to pollute every future request in that process.<br /> <br /> The same thing can easily happen in tests, if people try to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch">monkeypatch</a> without <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.patch">a contextmanager like </a><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.patch">mock.patch</a>. The effect here is pollution of all future tests run in that process, rather than pollution of all future requests. This is a huge cause of flakiness in our test suite. It's so bad, and so hard to thoroughly prevent, that we have basically given up and are moving to one-test-per-process isolation instead.<br /> <br /> So that's a third pain point for us. Mutable global state is not merely available in Python, it's underfoot everywhere you look: every module, every class, every list or dictionary or set attached to a module or class, every singleton object created at module level. It requires discipline and some Python expertise to avoid accidentally polluting global state at runtime of your program.</p><h3>Enter strict modules</h3><p>One reasonable take might be that we’re stretching Python beyond what it was intended for. It works great for smaller teams on smaller codebases that can maintain good discipline around how to use it, and we should switch to a less dynamic language.<br /> <br /> But we’re past the point of codebase size where a rewrite is even feasible. And more importantly, despite these pain points, there’s a lot more that we like about Python, and overall our developers enjoy working in Python. So it’s up to us to figure out how we can make Python work at this scale, and continue to work as we grow.<br /> <br /> We have an idea: <strong>strict modules</strong>.<br /> <br /> Strict modules are a new Python module type marked with __strict__ = True at the top of the module, and implemented by leveraging many of the low-level extensibility mechanisms already provided by Python. A custom <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#finders-and-loaders">module loader</a> parses the code using the ast module, performs abstract interpretation on the loaded code to analyze it, applies various transformations to the AST, and then compiles the modified AST back into Python byte code using the built-in compile function.</p><h3>Side-effect-free on import</h3><p>Strict modules place some limitations on what can happen at module top-level. All module-level code, including decorators and functions/initializers called at module level, must be pure (side-effect free, no I/O). This is verified statically at compile time via the abstract interpreter.<br /> <br /> This means that strict modules are <strong>side-effect-free on import</strong>: bad interactions of import-time side effects are no longer possible! Because we verify this with abstract interpretation that is able to understand a large subset of Python, we avoid over-restricting Python’s expressiveness: many types of dynamic code without side effects are still fine at module level, including many kinds of decorators, defining module-level constants via list or dictionary comprehensions, etc.<br /> <br /> Let’s make that a bit more concrete with an example. This is a valid strict module:</p><pre>&quot;&quot;&quot;Module docstring.&quot;&quot;&quot;<br />__strict__ = True</pre><pre>from utils import log_to_network</pre><pre>MY_LIST = [1, 2, 3]<br />MY_DICT = {x: x+1 for x in MY_LIST}</pre><pre>def log_calls(func):<br />    def _wrapped(*args, **kwargs):<br />        log_to_network(f&quot;{func.__name__} called!&quot;)<br />        return func(*args, **kwargs)<br />    return _wrapped</pre><pre>@log_calls<br />def hello_world():<br />    log_to_network(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)</pre><p>We can still use Python normally, including dynamic code such as a dictionary comprehension and a decorator used at module level. It’s no problem that we talk to the network within the _wrapped function or within hello_world, because they are not called at module level. But if we moved the log_to_network call out into the outer log_calls function, or we tried to use a side-effecting decorator like the earlier @route example, or added a hello_world() call at module level, this would no longer compile as a strict module.<br /> <br /> How do we know that the log_to_network or route functions are not safe to call at module level? We assume that anything imported from a non-strict module is unsafe, except for certain standard library functions that are known safe. If the utils module is strict, then we’d rely on the analysis of that module to tell us in turn whether log_to_network is safe.<br /> <br /> In addition to improving reliability, side-effect-free imports also remove a major barrier to safe incremental reload, as well as unlocking other avenues to explore speeding up imports. If module-level code is side-effect-free, we can safely execute individual statements in a module lazily on-demand when module attributes are accessed, instead of eagerly all at once. And given that the shape of all classes in a strict module are fully understood at compile time, in the future we could even try persisting module metadata (classes, functions, constants) resulting from module execution in order to provide a fast-path import for unchanged modules that doesn’t require re-executing the module-level byte-code from scratch.</p><h3>Immutability and slots</h3><p>Strict modules and classes defined in them are immutable after creation. The modules are made immutable by internally transforming the module body into a function with all of the global variables accessed as closure variables. These changes greatly reduce the surface area for accidental mutation of global state, though mutable global state is still available if you opt-in via module-level mutable containers.<br /> <br /> Classes defined in strict modules must also have all members defined in __init__ and are automatically given __slots__ by the module loader’s AST transformation, so it’s not possible to tack on additional ad-hoc instance attributes later. So for example, in this class:</p><pre>class Person:<br />    def __init__(self, name, age):<br />        self.name = name<br />        self.age = age</pre><p>The strict-modules AST transformation will observe the assignments to attributes name and age in __init__ and add an implicit __slots__ = ('name', 'age') to the class, preventing assignment of any other attributes to instances of the class. (If you are using type annotations, we will also pick up class-level attribute type declarations such as name: str and add them to the slots list as well.)<br /> <br /> These restrictions don’t just make the code more reliable, they help it run faster as well. Automatically transforming classes to add __slots__ makes them more memory efficient and eliminates per-instance dictionary lookups, speeding up attribute access. Transforming the module body to make it immutable also eliminates dictionary lookups for accessing top-level variables. And we can further optimize these patterns within the Python runtime for further benefits.</p><h3>What’s next?</h3><p>Strict modules are still experimental. We have a working prototype and are in the early stages of rolling it out in production. We hope to follow up on this blog post in the future, with a report on our experience and a more detailed review of the implementation. If you’ve run into similar problems and have thoughts on this approach, we’d love to hear them!</p><p><em>Many thanks to Dino Viehland and Shiyu Wang, who implemented strict modules and contributed to this post.</em><br /> <br /> If you want to learn more about this work or are interested joining one of our engineering teams, please visit our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/jobs/?q=instagram">careers page</a>, follow us <a href="https://www.facebook.com/instagramengineering/">on Facebook</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/instagrameng">on Twitter</a>.</p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=c0bb9245c834" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/python-at-scale-strict-modules-c0bb9245c834">Python at Scale: Strict Modules</a> was originally published in <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com">Instagram Engineering</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p></p>

        <h2>Making instagram.com faster: Part 3 — cache first</h2>
        </a>
            
            <p><span class="company">Instagram Engineering - Medium</span>: <h3>Making Instagram.com faster: Part 3 — cache first</h3><p>In recent years <a href="http://instagram.com">instagram.com</a> has seen a lot of changes — we’ve launched stories, filters, creation tools, notifications, and direct messaging as well as a myriad of other features and enhancements. However, as the product grew, a side effect was that our web performance began to slow. Over the last year we made a conscious effort to improve this. This ongoing effort has thus far resulted in almost 50% cumulative improvement to our feed page load time. This series of blog posts will outline some of the work we’ve done that led to these improvements. In <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/making-instagram-com-faster-part-1-62cc0c327538">part 1</a> we talked about prefetching data and in <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/making-instagram-com-faster-part-2-f350c8fba0d4">part 2</a> we talked about improving performance by pushing data directly to the client rather than waiting for the client to request the data.</p><h4>Cache first</h4><p>Since we’re already pushing data to the client at the earliest possible time in the page load — the only faster way to get data to the client would be to not have to fetch or push any data at all. We can do this using a cache-first rendering approach, though this does mean that we have to display stale feed data to users for a short period of time. With this approach, when the page is loaded, we immediately present users with a cached copy of their previous feed and stories tray, and then replace it with fresh data once it’s available.</p><p>We use Redux to manage state on instagram.com, so at a high level the way we implemented this was to store a subset of our Redux store on the client in an indexedDB table, and then rehydrate the store when the page first loads. However, because of the asynchronous nature of indexedDB access, server data fetching, and user interactions, we can run into problems where the user interacts with the cached state, but then we want to ensure that those interactions are still applied to the new state when it arrives from the server.</p><p>For example, if we were to handle caching in a naive way we could run into the following problem: We begin loading from cache and from the network concurrently and since the cached feed is ready first, we display it to the user. The user then proceeds to like a post, but once the network response for the latest feed comes back it overwrites that post with a copy that doesn’t include the like action that the user applied to the cached copy (see the diagram below).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yw3otH31zNaPYawMbmbM7g.png" /><figcaption>Race conditions when the user interacts with cached data (Redux actions in green, state in grey)</figcaption></figure><p>To solve this issue, we needed a way to apply interactions to the cached state, but also store those interactions so they can be replayed later over the new state from the server. If you’ve ever used Git or similar source control systems before, this problem might seem familiar. If we think of the cached feed state as a branch, and the server feed response as master, what we effectively want to do is to do a rebase operation, applying the commits (likes, comments etc.) from our local branch onto the head of master.<br /> <br /> This brings us to the following design:</p><ul><li>On page load, we send a request for the new data (or wait for it to be pushed)</li><li>Create a staged subset of the Redux state</li><li>While the request/push is pending, we store any dispatched actions</li><li>Once the request resolves, we apply the action with the new data and any actions that have been pending to the staged state</li><li>When the staged state is committed, we simply replace the current state with the staged one.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NGABlwJjUR2g0T23xTvWoQ.png" /><figcaption>Fixing interaction race conditions with staging (Redux actions in green, state in grey)</figcaption></figure><p>By having a staging state, all the existing reducer behavior can be reused. It also keeps the staged state (which has the most recent data) separate from the current state. Also, since staging is implemented using Redux, we just need to dispatch actions to use it!</p><h4>API</h4><a href="https://medium.com/media/58940fc0a5a6658f4825edd4fa46f069/href">https://medium.com/media/58940fc0a5a6658f4825edd4fa46f069/href</a><p>The staging API consists of two main functions: stagingAction &amp; stagingCommit (as well as a couple of others for handling reverts and edge cases that we won't cover here).</p><p>stagingAction accepts a promise that resolves an action to be dispatched to the staged state. It initializes the staging state and keeps track of any actions that have been dispatched since it was initialized. In the source control analogy we can think of this as creating a local branch as any actions that take place will now be queued and applied over the staged state when the new data arrives.</p><p>stagingCommit commits the staging state to the current state. If any async actions on the staging state are pending, it will wait before committing. This is similar to a rebase in source control terms, in that we apply all our local changes (from the cache branch) on top of master (the new data from the server), leaving our local branch up to date.</p><p>To enable staging, we wrap the root reducer with a reducer enhancer that handles the stagingCommit action and applies the staged actions to the new state. To use all this, we just need to dispatch the relevant actions and everything is handled for us. For example, if we want to fetch a new feed and apply it to a staged state, we can do something similar to the following:</p><a href="https://medium.com/media/61252076a13255e5dd8f9d3f9292372a/href">https://medium.com/media/61252076a13255e5dd8f9d3f9292372a/href</a><p>Using cache-first rendering for both feed posts and the stories tray led to a 2.5% and 11% improvement in respective display done times and bought the user experience more in-line with what is available on the native iOS and android Instagram apps.</p><h4>Stay tuned for part 4</h4><p>In part 4 we’ll cover how we reduced the size of our codebase and improved its performance through code size and execution optimizations.

        <h2>Implementing Dark Mode in iOS 13</h2>
        </a>
            
            <p><span class="company">Instagram Engineering - Medium</span>: <figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*d8-4IYqquJ0yGIKZ3bjzWg.png" /></figure><p>One of the most exciting announcements at WWDC this year was the introduction of platform-wide dark mode in iOS 13. During WWDC a group of enthusiastic iOS engineers and designers from Instagram’s design systems team banded together to begin plotting out what it would take to adopt dark mode in our app. This week’s update to Instagram includes full support for iOS dark mode. This took months of work and collaboration between numerous design and engineering teams in the company. As such, we wanted to take some time to share how we approached adopting dark mode and some of the obstacles we encountered along the way.</p><h3>API Philosophy</h3><p>Apple did an excellent job shaping how dark mode works in iOS 13. Most of the heavy lifting is done on your behalf by UIKit. Because of this, one of the key principles we had when building out dark mode support in our app was that we should “stand on the shoulders of giants” and try to stick with Apple’s APIs as much as possible. This is beneficial for several reasons.</p><ul><li><strong>Ease of use</strong> — UIKit does most of the work in selecting appropriate colors and transitioning between light mode and dark mode. If we wrote our own APIs we’d have to handle this ourselves.</li><li><strong>Maintainability</strong> — Apple maintains the APIs so we don’t have to. Any wrappers we have can ultimately be switched over to just use UIKit APIs as soon as our minimum supported OS version is iOS 13.</li><li><strong>Familiarity</strong> — Newcomers to Instagram’s iOS codebase who are familiar with how UIKit does dark mode will feel right at home.</li></ul><p>That being said, we didn’t use UIKit’s APIs alone since most developers in the company and our build systems are all still using Xcode 10, and introducing iOS 13 APIs would cause build breakages. We went with the approach of writing thin wrappers around UIKit APIs that are compatible with Xcode 10 and iOS 12.</p><p>Another principle we followed was to introduce as few APIs as possible, and only when needed. The key reason for this was to reduce complexity for product teams adopting dark mode: it’s harder to misunderstand or misuse APIs if there are fewer of them. We started off with just wrappers around dynamic colors and a semantic color palette that our design systems team created, then introduced additional APIs over time as the need grew within the company. To increase awareness and ensure steady adoption, whenever we introduced a new API we announced it in an internal dark mode working group and documented it in an internal wiki page for the project.</p><h3>Primitives and Concepts</h3><p>Apple defines some handy dark mode primitives and concepts, and since we decided to build on top of their APIs we embraced these as well. Covering them at a high level, we have.</p><ul><li><strong>Dynamic colors </strong>— Colors that change in response to light mode/dark mode changes. Also can change in response to “elevation” and accessibility settings.</li><li><strong>Dynamic images</strong> — Similar to dynamic colors, these are images that change in response to light mode/dark mode changes.</li><li><strong>Semantic colors</strong> — Named dynamic colors that serve a specific purpose. For example “destructive button color” or “link text color”.</li><li><strong>Elevation level</strong> — Things presented modally in dark mode change colors very slightly to demonstrate that they’re a layer on top of the underlying UI. This concept largely hasn’t existed in light mode because dark dimming layers are sufficient to differentiate modal layers presented on top of others.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/884/1*z6Y8hnxTemNleCvXwDiEKQ.png" /></figure><h3>Building UIKit Wrappers</h3><p>One of the key APIs iOS 13 introduces for dark mode support is UIColor’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicolor/3238040-colorwithdynamicprovider">+colorWithDynamicProvider:</a> method, which generates colors that automatically adapt to dark mode. This was the very first API we sought to wrap for use within Instagram and is still one of our most used dark mode APIs. We’ll walk through implementing it as a case study in building a backwards-compatible wrapper.<br /> <br /> The first step in building such an API is defining a macro that allows us to conditionally compile out code for people that are still using stable versions of Xcode. This is what ours looks like:</p><a href="https://medium.com/media/efe5c63d90ef011b29b593310ecbc250/href">https://medium.com/media/efe5c63d90ef011b29b593310ecbc250/href</a><p>Next we declare a wrapper function. Our wrapper for dynamic colors looks like this:</p><a href="https://medium.com/media/a4b98240258d935aebd4dcf92babe6e7/href">https://medium.com/media/a4b98240258d935aebd4dcf92babe6e7/href</a><p>Within this function we use our macro to ensure that developers using older versions of Xcode can still compile. We also introduce a runtime check so that the app continues to function normally on older versions of iOS. If both checks pass we simply call into the iOS 13 +colorWithDynamicProvider: API, otherwise we fall back to the light mode variant.</p><a href="https://medium.com/media/1dce7091c966e653da6424e97a94973c/href">https://medium.com/media/1dce7091c966e653da6424e97a94973c/href</a><p>You may notice that we’re passing an IGTraitCollection into IGColorWithDynamicProvider's block instead of a UITraitCollection. We introduced IGTraitCollection as a struct that contain's UITraitCollection's userInterfaceStyle and userInterfaceLevel values as isLight and isElevated respectively since those properties are only available when linked with newer iOS versions. More on that later.<br /> <br /> Now that we have IGColorWithDynamicProvider we can use it everywhere in the app where we need to use dynamic colors. Developers can use this freely without worrying about build failures or run time crashes regardless of what version of Xcode they or their peers are using. Instagram has historically had a semantic color palette that was introduced in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/11/instagrams-big-redesign-goes-live-with-a-colorful-new-icon-black-and-white-app-and-more/">our 2016 redesign</a>, and we collaborated with our design systems team to update all the colors in it to support dark mode using IGColorWithDynamicProvider. Here’s an example of one of these colors.</p><a href="https://medium.com/media/31d626b67b367b7dbeadfcf758c9cade/href">https://medium.com/media/31d626b67b367b7dbeadfcf758c9cade/href</a><p>Once we had this pattern defined for wrapping UIKit’s API we continued to add more as they were needed. The set we ended up with is:</p><ul><li>IGColorWithDynamicProvider as shown here</li><li>IGImageWithDynamicProvider for creating “dynamic images“ that automatically adapt to dark mode.</li><li>IGActivityIndicator functions for creating activity indicators with styles that work in light mode, dark mode, and older versions of iOS.</li><li>IGSetOverrideUserInterfaceStyle for forcing views or view controllers into particular interface styles.</li><li>IGSetOverrideElevationLevel for forcing view controllers into particular elevation levels.</li></ul><p><em>Small side note: We discovered towards the end of our dark mode adoption that our implementation of dynamic colors had equality implications because a new instance of </em><em>UIColor was returned each time and the only thing that was comparable about each was the block passed in. In order to resolve this we modified our API slightly to create single instances of each of semantic colors so that they were comparable. Doing something like </em><em>dispatch_once-ing your semantic colors or using asset catalog-based colors and </em><em>+colorNamed: will produce comparable colors if your app is sensitive to color equality.</em></p><h3>Fake Dark Mode</h3><p>One tricky thing when adopting technologies in iOS betas is getting adequate test coverage. Convincing people using the internal build of Instagram to install iOS 13 on their devices isn’t a great idea because it’s unstable and challenging to help set up, and even if we were to get people testing on iOS 13 the builds we distribute internally were still largely being linked against the iOS 12 SDK so the changes wouldn’t show up anyway.</p><p>I briefly touched on our IGTraitCollection wrapper for UITraitCollection that came in handy in the course of building out dark mode. One clever testing trick this IGTraitCollection wrapper afforded us is something we’ve come to call “fake dark mode” — which is an internal setting that overrides IGTraitCollection to become dark even in iOS 12! Nate Stedman, one of our iOS engineers in New York, came up with this setting when we were first working on dark mode.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*cjJ-GRFtjyw7Yfr3_m0YXw.png" /><figcaption><em>Our internal menu’s “fake dark mode” option, and fake dark mode running in a build linked against the iOS 12 SDK.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Our API for generating IGTraitCollections from UITraitCollections came to look like this.</p><a href="https://medium.com/media/c7579547af72ddf98cada4471aa34688/href">https://medium.com/media/c7579547af72ddf98cada4471aa34688/href</a><p>Where _IGIsDarkModeDebugEnabled is backed by an NSUserDefaults flag for fake dark mode. There are of course some limitations with faking out dark mode in iOS 12, most notably</p><ul><li>userInterfaceLevel isn’t available in iOS 12, so “elevated“ dynamic colors never appear in fake dark mode.</li><li>Forcing particular styles via our -setOverrideInterfaceStyle: wrapper has no effect in fake dark mode.</li><li>UIKit components that use their default colors don’t adapt to fake dark mode in iOS 12 since they have no knowledge of dark mode.</li></ul><p>With this addition to our dark mode wrappers we were able to get much broader test coverage than we otherwise would have.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Dark mode has been a highly requested featured of ours for quite a while.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8S7186vNCRn3kh6E9hWngg.png" /><figcaption>A recent public Q&amp;A with Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram</figcaption></figure><p>We had been a little reluctant in introducing dark mode in the past because it would’ve been a tremendous undertaking, but the excellent tools that Apple provides and their emphasis on dark mode in iOS 13 finally made it possible for us! Of course the actual implementation still wasn’t easy, we’ve been working on this since WWDC and it demanded ample design and engineering deep dives into every part of the app (and admittedly, we have probably missed some). This journey has been worth it, on top of the benefits dark mode provides such as eye strain reduction and battery savings, it makes our app look right at home on iOS 13!</p><p><em>A huge thank you to Jeremy Lawrence, Nate Stedman, Cameron Roth, Ryan Olson, Garrett Olinger, Paula Guzman, Héctor Ramos, Aaron Pang, and numerous others who contributed to our efforts to adopt dark mode. Dark mode is also available in Instagram for Android.</em></p><p><em>If you want to learn more about this work or are interested joining one of our engineering teams, please visit our </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/jobs/?q=instagram"><em>careers page</em></a><em>, follow us </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/instagramengineering/"><em>on Facebook</em></a><em> or </em><a href="https://twitter.com/instagrameng"><em>on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=58802b43c0f2" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/instagram-darkmode-58802b43c0f2">Implementing Dark Mode in iOS 13</a> was originally published in <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com">Instagram Engineering</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p></p>

        <h2>Interview with Tamar Shapiro, Instagram’s Head of Analytics</h2>
        </a>
            
            <p><span class="company">Instagram Engineering - Medium</span>: <p>Tamar is the Head of Analytics at Instagram. She supports a team of data scientists and data engineers responsible for analytics, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">data science</a>, and experimentation. Tamar also leads the Diversity and Inclusion task force at Instagram. She is a passionate advocate for women in tech and has served as a mentor for <a href="https://www.mindsmatter.org/">Minds Matter</a> and <a href="https://www.women-unlimited.com/">Women Unlimited</a>, as a speaker for <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a>, and as co-chair of the Analytics Collective.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*XnYj-RwRD7bYSrXvb41pGQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>Tamar Shapiro, Instagram’s Head of Analytics</figcaption></figure><p><em>This interview was conducted by Serena, an Instagram engineering manager.</em></p><p><strong>How did you become an engineer?</strong></p><p>When I was in college, the field of Data Science did not yet exist. I studied Statistics &amp; Biometry in undergrad. Later on, I went to graduate school for Engineering.</p><p><strong>What was your first coding language?</strong></p><p>I used Java when I took my first computer science class, but most of my math and statistics classes required SAS, SPSS, and MATLAB.</p><p><strong>What do you listen to while you work?</strong></p><p>Believe it or not, I don’t listen to music at all while working. I think it’s distracting. Plus, these days I’m not at my desk long enough to listen to music anyway.</p><p><strong>What do you do when you get stuck on a problem?</strong></p><p>I like to talk it out with people. Discussing the problem out loud helps me think about the problem differently, and it helps to hear from other people who either have encountered a similar problem before or may look at things from a different perspective.</p><p><strong>What do you do when you feel a lot of pressure?</strong></p><p>I usually like to take a break. If I have time, I’ll take a walk around the NY building’s floors or our office’s amazing rooftop garden. If I don’t have time, I just take a beat — I take some deep breaths to clear my head, and that can be very helpful.</p><p><strong>Please tell us about your favorite project at IG.</strong></p><p>This is like being asked to pick your favorite child! My recent favorite is the private like counts test, a product exploration aimed at shifting the focus from the quantity of interactions to the quality of interactions on your feed posts. What I really love about it is that we are challenging the status quo. We are thinking differently about a part of the product that has been a vital part of the Instagram experience from the beginning.</p><p><strong>What makes working at Instagram unique?</strong></p><p>After two years here, I can confidently say that it’s our culture. One of our values is “people first” — meaning we’re always laser focused on how to create the best experience for our community. We approach every project through the lens of the people who use Instagram.</p><p><strong>How would you describe the engineering culture at Instagram?</strong></p><p>Very collaborative. We put the Instagram community first, and we work together to create the best products. Everyone here is so passionate about building amazing products for our community, and it’s so energizing to be a part of it.</p><p><strong>What makes you excited about coming into work every day?</strong></p><p>Working on a product that impacts the lives of billions of people throughout the world. It’s incredibly exciting. It’s also amazing to think about the potential impact we can have with every new idea and project we work on. It’s a huge responsibility, and one that we and I take very seriously.</p><p><strong>Your favorite place to eat in the city?</strong></p><p>I love sushi. Sushi of Gari is my favorite neighborhood sushi place in New York.</p><p><strong>What is your favorite thing to eat at the office?</strong></p><p>A smoothie from Frozen Palm, our smoothie bar in the New York office, which provides a lot of great (and healthy!) options.</p><p><strong>What’s your favorite Instagram account?</strong></p><p>@<a href="https://www.instagram.com/GirlsWhoCode/">girlswhocode</a>, which is an organization that I volunteer for. They work on (and post about) important research that’s relevant to women in tech, and their ultimate goal is to help young women find career paths in STEM. I like to follow along to see what programs they’re working on and to hear stories about some of the alumni.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*y2IgyGOkjlF7fByq-dqFlw.jpeg" /></figure><p><strong>Tell us about your happiest day at Instagram</strong></p><p>It was my second Faceversary (second-year mark at Facebook) and my team pulled out all the stops with flowers, cupcakes, etc. My manager, Adam Mosseri, was out of the office, but Nam, our head of engineering, surprised me at a meeting by printing Adam’s face on a piece of paper. We took a selfie with the cutout of Adam’s face, pretending he was there and celebrating with us. It was hilarious, but also very special for me because it was a great way to reflect back on all that’s happened over the past couple of years here.</p><p><strong>What is one of the best things you learned while working at Instagram</strong></p><p>The importance of good communication and context sharing. We work in such a fast-paced environment that often we assume people have the context they need to do their jobs well. Sometimes, it’s important to slow down and take the time to communicate the bigger picture.</p><p><strong>Coolest celebrity sighting at the office?</strong></p><p>The cast of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Rich_Asians_(film)">Crazy Rich Asians</a> visited the office, and many people were excited to see them in real life. We welcomed Henry Golding, Michelle Yeoh, Awkwafina, Ken Jeong, and book author Kevin Kwan for a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CrazyRichAsiansMovie/videos/235251237324338/">FB Live</a> from our New York office where they answered fan questions, and @evachen went Live with the cast from her Instagram account for a Q&amp;A ahead of the film’s release. If you haven’t seen the movie, you’re missing out :)</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*RxTEPKyt4g0x1OBiE2-Lng.jpeg" /><figcaption>Tamar’s desk</figcaption></figure><p><strong>What does your desk setup look like?</strong></p><p>It’s super clean. I am a neat freak and a minimalist too. I think a clean space helps me keep my focus. But it’s hard to keep a clean desk here because there’s always some new piece of swag that manages to make its way onto my desk.</p><p><strong>What career advice would you like to give to female engineers who are early in their careers?</strong></p><p>So many — but one I’d like to touch on here is the importance of networking. It’s easy to think that we need to just sit at our desks and do really good work, but that’s only one part of the equation.</p><p>It’s important to build relationships with people who are not in your immediate team, or company. Networks can open up opportunities for you in the future, and it’s also important to communicate your work with a broader audience. As women, I don’t think we advocate enough for ourselves, and we need to do a better job communicating our accomplishments.</p><p>Another is confidence. Women, especially those early in their careers, are often prone to self-doubt. It ends up being our biggest enemy as we second-guess ourselves too much. It prevents us from pursuing opportunities to be challenged and grow. How can we overcome it? For me, what really worked was the “fake it until you make it” mindset. Observe the behavior of your confident colleagues and try to mirror it. On this topic, I really recommend <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/05/the-confidence-gap/359815/"><em>The Confidence Gap</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><strong>How do you achieve work-life balance? Do you believe in work-life balance at all? :)</strong></p><p>I do! It’s all about setting boundaries and not apologizing for these boundaries. We need to be very diligent about where we draw that line. For me, this might mean that I leave the office by a certain time so I can have quality time with my kids in the evening, and for others it might be something else. The key is sticking to these boundaries and carving out the time that you need to achieve that balance.<br /> <br /><strong>Do you think work-life balance is harder to achieve as you become more and more senior in the company?</strong></p><p>I don’t think so. The demand definitely becomes greater, but you become better at ruthless prioritization.</p><p><strong>Most of the time, I don’t feel hindered by being a female engineer as I don’t have a problem speaking up or leaning in. But there are still times — for example, when I am pregnant — I worry that people will think less of me, and I worry whether I will still be able to meet my colleagues’ expectations. How can we overcome these thoughts?</strong></p><p>It’s a really great question and one that goes back to the confidence piece I mentioned earlier. Creating a human being is something to be very, very proud of — it’s amazing!</p><p>We need to think about success in our lives in a broader way than just our work. You are building a family, you are a talented engineer, and all of these things are what make you you.</p><p>I find that concerns around performance during a pregnancy are often a manifestation of our own self-doubt. While you might not feel as good or sharp as you’re used to, others are probably unaware, and you are your own worst critic. Everyone has good days and bad days, when they’re feeling distracted or not performing their best. We need to be kind to ourselves and be confident in our abilities.</p><p><em>If you want to learn more about this work or are interested joining one of our engineering teams, please visit our </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/jobs/?q=instagram"><em>careers page</em></a><em>, follow us </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/instagramengineering/"><em>on Facebook</em></a><em> or </em><a href="https://twitter.com/instagrameng"><em>on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=c81946d02b90" width="1" /><hr /><p><a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/interview-with-tamar-shapiro-instagrams-head-of-analytics-c81946d02b90">Interview with Tamar Shapiro, Instagram’s Head of Analytics</a> was originally published in <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com">Instagram Engineering</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p></p>

        </a>
            
            <p><span class="company">SoundCloud Backstage Blog</span>: Until recently, one of the top technical risks facing SoundCloud’s Android team was increasing build times. Our engineering leadership was well aware of the problem, and it was highlighted in our company’s quarterly goals and objectives as modularization. Faster build times means more productive developers. More productive developers are happier and can iterate on products more quickly. Modularization is key to decreasing build times, but avoiding work is another important part of the puzzle, and build caching is one way to avoid that work. Gradle, our tool for building Android, has a local file system cache that reuses outputs of previously performed tasks. We have been using the Gradle remote build cache in order to save our developers’ time. It helps us avoid redoing work that other teammates have already done or switching to old branches. However, to get the full benefits of caching, you have to go beyond simply setting it up.</p>

For that reason, we have established and grown an engineering team that is specialized in providing the best possible streaming experience to our users across multiple platforms. To do this, we combine the industry’s best-fitting solutions with our own custom technologies, libraries, and tools. In this article, let’s dive into how we improved latency in our Android application by leveraging a new engine for our player’s audio sink.</p>

        </a>
            
            <p><span class="company">SoundCloud Backstage Blog</span>: If there is anything like a silver bullet for creating meaningful and actionable alerts with a high signal-to-noise ratio, it is alerting based on service-level objectives (SLOs). Fulfilling a well-defined SLO is the very definition of meeting your users’ expectations. Conversely, a certain level of service errors is OK as long as you stay within the SLO — in other words, if the SLO grants you an error budget. Burning through this error budget too quickly is the ultimate signal that some rectifying action is needed. The faster the budget is burned, the more urgent it is that engineers get involved. This post describes how we implemented this concept at SoundCloud, enabling us to fulfill our SLOs without flooding our engineers on call with an unsustainable amount of pages.</p>

            <p><span class="company">SoundCloud Backstage Blog</span>: In the past, the Search Team at SoundCloud had high lead times for making updates to Elasticsearch clusters, either during the implementation of a new feature or simply while fixing a bug. This was because both tasks require us to reindex our catalog from scratch, which means reindexing more than 720 million users, tracks, playlists, and albums. Altogether, this process took up to one week, though there was even one scenario where it almost took one month to roll out a bug fix. In this post, I would like to share the concrete Elasticsearch tweaks we made so that we can now reindex our entire catalog in one hour.</p>

Here at SoundCloud, we hold retrospectives at the end of every iteration (every two weeks), and we often do them at the end of projects as well.</p>

As the size of our iOS codebase and team at SoundCloud grew, we faced challenges: long compile times and conflicts. Our productivity started to suffer as a result. We took inspiration from the work done in the backend (Building Products at SoundCloud) and applied it to mobile development. The main goal was to get back to a state where development is fun, fast, and would scale as the number of contributors grew. We modularized our iOS project by splitting it up into modules with well-defined responsibilities and public interfaces that interconnect them.</p>

Most recently, we started thinking about the work that a Data Scientist does, and how best to describe and share the process that we use to work on a business problem. Based on the experiences of our Data Scientists, we distilled a set of steps, tips and general guidance representing the best practices that we collectively know of and agree to as a community of practitioners.</p>

            <p><span class="company">SoundCloud Backstage Blog</span>: If you’re a regular visitor to this blog, you might be aware that we have been transitioning to a microservices based architecture over the past four to five years, as we have shared insights into the process and the related challenges on multiple occasions. To recap, adopting a microservices architecture has allowed us to regain team autonomy by breaking up our monolithic backend into dozens of decoupled services, each encapsulating a well defined portion of our product domain. Every service is built and deployed individually, communicating with other services over the network via light-weight data interchange formats such as JSON or Thrift.
What we haven’t touched on so far is how a microservice at SoundCloud looks backstage.</p>

Entering text requires navigating a virtual keyboard to individual letters, numbers, and characters one at a time – such a nightmare! Plus, letters, numbers, and special characters are spread across three screens. The more secure your password is, the worse the experience is.

            <p><span class="company">SoundCloud Backstage Blog</span>: Over the last 100 years we have dialed into radio stations at home, on the road, or in the office to access a curated mix of top hits delivered to us by our favorite DJ. With more and more of our daily activities taking place online, we find our source of music now comes from a mix of our mobile phones, our desktop computers and the radio - and is available to us whenever we need it.
The amount of music available today is endless. The music scene has never been so vibrant. A proliferation of production tools at low cost and the ease at which an artist can share their sounds, gives everyone the opportunity to share their work at any time, with only a few clicks. Keeping this in mind, we set out to determine: How can we bring a radio like experience to SoundCloud that would enable you to tune-in and lean back?</p>

            <p><span class="company">SoundCloud Backstage Blog</span>: Last week, we open-sourced LightCycle, an Android library that helps break logic out of  and  classes into small, self-contained components called LightCycles. Components that typically need to be aware of  and  lifecycle events include presenters, UI tracking code, input processors and more. We’ve been using LightCycle extensively in the SoundCloud Music & Audio and SoundCloud Pulse apps over the last year.</p>

            <p><span class="company">SoundCloud Backstage Blog</span>: At SoundCloud we have been building for the Android platform since 2010. Much has changed since then: the team has grown, the list of features has grown, and our audience has grown. Today, eight engineers are working full time on the official SoundCloud app, across various areas, with contributions pouring in from other parts of the organization. Due to the growing complexity and number of contributions, the app’s size has grown substantially. Currently the app consists of approximately 1200 Java source files, not counting tests, containing approximately 86000 lines of code. This doesn’t include native code, such as our playback or recording stacks. We’re not the first to run into Android’s limits in terms of build tools. An internal limitation of Dalvik’s byte code format (DEX), which I will explain in more detail, can leave you unable to build after your codebase reaches a certain size. If you fail to anticipate this, it might happen during the most inconvenient time, such as when you are preparing for a release. Part of our job in Core Engineering at SoundCloud is to make sure our developers are happy and productive; not being able to build our app anymore makes for neither happy nor productive developers. While there are a number of posts on this topic, I would like to describe in more detail what we have done to combat Android’s method limit, what things worked well and what didn’t work so well, what it actually means to use the  tool’s  switch and what you can do to improve application health with regards to size.</p>

            <p><span class="company">SoundCloud Backstage Blog</span>: In
previous
blog
posts,
we discussed how SoundCloud has been moving towards a microservice architecture.
Soon we had hundreds of services, with many thousand instances running and
changing at the same time. With our existing monitoring set-up, mostly based on
StatsD and Graphite, we ran into a number of serious limitations. What we
really needed was a system with the following features: A multi-dimensional data model, so that data can be sliced and diced
at will, along dimensions like instance, service, endpoint, and method. Operational simplicity, so that you can spin up a monitoring server
where and when you want, even on your local workstation, without
setting up a distributed storage backend or reconfiguring the world. Scalable data collection and decentralized architecture, so that you
can reliably monitor the many instances of your services, and
independent teams can set up independent monitoring servers. Finally, a powerful query language that leverages the data model for
meaningful alerting (including easy silencing) and graphing (for
dashboards and for ad-hoc exploration). All of these features existed in various systems. However, we could not
identify a system that combined them all until a colleague started an ambitious
pet project in 2012 that aimed to do so. Shortly thereafter, we decided to
develop it into SoundCloud’s monitoring system:
Prometheus was born.</p>

Berlin’s first all-women hackathon. With SoundCloud’s Amelie Anglade
the then newly-appointed the Berlin Geekettes Tech Ambassador, we
agreed that it was a great idea to produce the hackathon as a
partnership between the Geekettes and the women developers of
SoundCloud.  Fast forward to the first weekend of March, when the vision became
reality: after 24 hours of hacking, 80 women demoed 29 projects across
a range of different platforms, from a belt transformed into a game
controller to an app aimed to help toddlers learn to do everyday
tasks.</p>

Retronyms. They’ve built some amazing
community features into their app
Tabletop
using the SoundCloud API and have open sourced their CloudSeeder
Devkit.  This post was written for us by David Shu. David is a
software engineer at the Retronyms and has worked on a number of iOS
apps, including Tabletop and Dokobots. He currently resides in San
Francisco, CA. We recently built a SoundCloud-powered community into our app
Tabletop,
a modular audio environment for the iPad, using the
CocoaSoundCloudAPI.
The project, CloudSeeder, lets users browse, stream, favorite, and
comment on Tabletop tracks without ever leaving the app. As developers, we discovered tons of talented users in our Tabletop
community. At the same time, our users found inspiration from each
other and a new showcase for their creations. To share in the
excitement of community creation with all developers, today we’re
releasing the CloudSeeder Devkit as open source on
Google Code.</p>

            <p><span class="company">SoundCloud Backstage Blog</span>: A few weeks ago, I attended News Hack Day in San Francisco.
News Hack Days are events that bring together journalists, developers and designers for multi
day creative coding and brainstorming sessions. I really like the idea of hack days that bring together people from different backgrounds. After
chatting with a few journalists, it became obvious to me that recording interviews on the phone
is a real pain. I saw this as an opportunity to build a fun app that would make this easier for
people.</p>

        </a>
            
            <p><span class="company">SoundCloud Backstage Blog</span>: There are many approaches to building libraries that wrap HTTP APIs. For many of our
officially supported SDKs we
chose to build light wrappers around HTTP client libraries with a few added features
to make it easier to work with the SoundCloud API. This approach has a few benefits.
It guarantees a certain consistency and is relatively easy to maintain. It’s also fairly
future proof. Changes in the HTTP API do not typically require updates to client libraries. Sometimes however, you might be looking for something a bit more feature-full, or with
more abstraction from our HTTP API. That’s why I was really happy to see that the great folks at
SocialFolders built an alternative SoundCloud Ruby gem and
released it to the public. You can check out their blog post
about it or go straight to the source on GitHub.</p>

            <p><span class="company">SoundCloud Backstage Blog</span>: Waveforms I’ve worked at SoundCloud for over two years now, and if there’s one thing I do a lot, it’s color waveforms. Tons of them. And, I’ve done it several different ways. Today, Johannes and I are pumped to announce a new JavaScript library called Waveform.js that will assist you in your coloring efforts. But first, let’s take some time to look back and learn from past techniques.</p>

This has become a regular event in the Toronto tech scene, thanks to excellent organizing by Leila Boujnane and Corey Reid. SoundCloud joined several other API providers, including Atomic Reach, Context.IO, FreshBooks, Shopify, TinEye, Twilio, Trendspottr, WordPress and YellowAPI. The idea behind the event is simple: find a team (or go solo) and build an app using one or more of the APIs presented by sponsors. All apps have to be demoable by 5pm at which time you pitch to the judges who select the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winners.</p>

So when Johannes Wagener told me he was adding an  event to our JS SDK, I immediately began work on Wave Raid: Quest for the Timed Comment.</p>

so you can write apps that create sound files using one of their voices (including
hip-hop and country!). Take a listen to some sample voices. We’re calling on our developer community to mashup SoundCloud and Acapela. Show
us what you can do using a text to speech service with the best audio content
platform on the web. Maybe you want to have your email read (or sung!) to you
layered on some instrumental or drum tracks. We think there are loads of options
for making interesting and accessible apps using these two services.</p>

If you build an app or web service that generates any type of sound, it’s easy to connect it to SoundCloud and enable your users to share their creations across the web. Allowing users to share what they create to their existing social networks and the SoundCloud community brings great value in a variety of use cases. If you have an app for beat making, you can let your users post their creations to a dedicated group on SoundCloud. For aspiring music makers, it’s valuable and fun to get feedback from friends on Facebook. And for someone recording an interview with their phone, it’s super handy to be able to post the audio directly to a blog. In addition, a sharing feature is obviously practical for sending files to collaborators or moving audio between devices.</p>
